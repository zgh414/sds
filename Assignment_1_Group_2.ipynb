I liked the fact that I was emailed about my package movement. I just don\\'t like the fact that it is delivered without my presence. But still I will use and recommend them.\\nTailor Brands are a fraud based service, I met the same issues of fraudulent charges as other victims here. Upon purchasing a subscription plan, they somehow sign you up for their subscription without your notice. And issuing refunded was not accepted.\\n\\nSuch unethical practice has been reported by other users. I think I will spread the words, meanwhile by clicking their Google and Facebook ad until I get refunded.\\n\\nIf they use this way to generating income, it is not a good sign. I believe they won\\'t last long in the business and Investors should stop funding such a company.\\nI went to a Mavis for a car state inspection, the technician inspected the car and I noticed he pull my tires off to inspect my cars brakes, before putting my tire back he hit using a hammer the drums maybe to put it in position and it cause it to loose some piece inside the drum probably the auto adjuster and when I left after first 2 mins I felt a bad noise coming from the exact drum that were inspected and hit with the hammer, I drove back to the shop again and the technician lift the car to inspect the drum I notice some pieces fall from the drum (a small coil and a little broken metallic piece) then he went inside the shop and came back after 5 mins to apparently put back the coil, I asked him about what happened and he didn\\'t explain to me what exactly he did to fix my car back, he only said everything is fine right now and because I was in a rush I drove off the shop, right now I have bad feeling, I don\\'t feel safe driving my car because he had to show to me what happened and what he did to fix it, I would like to go to a Mavis shop to have my car lifted and the tech show to me what was done there, thanks\\nThey sell games at very competitive prices, and there is no worry of the game codes being obtained illegitimately.  After hearing about some game code retailers allowing stolen codes to be sold on their site I have been more mindful of how the game codes I buy are obtained.  Bundle Stars offer exactly what you expect at prices lower than most other sites.\\nMassive hype about \"pay when you collect the car\", then got through to T&C\\'s and it said \"pay £36.75 now\" so I thought I had a good deal and best to pay.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey emptied the full £296.00 off my card instantly. Phoned them to say otherwise and cancel, the guy was laughing and put me on hold for EIGHT minutes after he realised that I was cancelling regardless of his poor attempts to keep me. \\r\\n\\r\\nFound a better company £101.00 cheaper and 100 times more polite and do not lie.\\r\\n\\r\\nPretty sure it\\'s illegal to advertise and do the complete opposite. I have since had two other e-shot campaigns.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe worst car rental company I have ever dealt with.\\nour driver arrived minutes after calling. He got \\r\\nus to our hotel quickly. It was a good expierence.\\nLoved the vegan snack pack. The salt and vinegar chips were very tasty, and the nutiva dark chocolate spread was to die for! There was a great variety to choose from!\\nI had bought round Christmas ornaments and they were adorable!\\nQuality and service were perfect! Would use them again and recommend them to family and friends.\\nVery Good Course\\nthe items ordered were delivered in one box in a timely manner, however the tape holding the lid in place was a single layer, placed off target, leaving a gap in the package where small items could have slipped out.  The compression hose sizing is NOT accurate and so tight they are very difficult to put on.  The other items were as expected.\\nAlways prompt knowledgeable and efficient   Alice is wonderful\\nvery smooth transition notwithstanding all the paperwork\\nWas fast and great amazing quality\\nThriftbook.com is the ONLY place I buy my books from. If they don\\'t have the book I\\'m looking for I just simply wait. They now have an app that makes my shopping more convenient. Along with a great rewards program. Not to mention free shipping. If your looking for a great reliable company, look no further than Thriftbooks.\\nThe flag came quickly. It looks good.\\nVery disappointed. I was told that someone will call to schedule an appointment to deliver but that never happened. After not hearing from anyone in weeks I called and they schedule an appointment. My delivery came and cabinets was discolored, damaged, not painted in areas, missing parts and doors. I called and was told it was on back order and I have not received anything yet. It’s been weeks. No one followerd up with me. On top of that they left a cabinet on the porch. Once my contractor started putting up cabinets he noticed three different area of cabinets space is either to small to fit all cabinets  or to big for the cabinets to fit from the beginning to end of the wall.  The space was measured by the company twice. She came out to check measurements. At this time I have no answers. No one has returned my calls and I still don’t have my missing parts. Don’t get any cabinets  from here if have had read these reviews before I purchased you cabinets. I would have ran fast! But a friend recommended this place so I went off of her experience.\\nThere was no Bank Information but one Logo only and received 4 boxes\\nwith same check numbers but I only ordered 2 boxes.

Definitely would recommend this...\\nR & G Brenner over ten years and i have had a excellent experience each.\\nThe framed print arrived in perfect condition and in a timely manner.  It really brightens up the eating area in our kitchen.  Love it!\\nI always enjoy booking through Priceline. I get great rooms at affordable prices. I have tried other companies,  but none are as easy to use as Priceline.\\nArrived in great timing after ordering, in excellent time shape and exactly what I was expecting\\ni ordered 100 pens for my husband\\'s 60th birthday. They were thank you gifts for everyone who attended. I received my order ahead of schedule, which I was surprised!

Only disappointment was the bar was closed when we got back at half midnight.\\nI highly recommend this seller! Perfect service:)\\nWe used dial 7 to and from LaGuardia recently and were very impressed with their organization and punctuality. Receiving a text with instructions once my plane landed was very helpful.The drivers were courteous and safe and the cars were immaculate. My only complaint is that the cost was significantly more each way than what was projected. The driver seemed to make the price up on the spot and didn\\'t use my coupon code. Overall, it was a great experience and we would use them again.\\nI’ve found on my second loan, Lending Tree to be a great resource and an easy to use website to apply for multiple loan offers to choose from.  Outstanding service and turn around times from my application to getting the funds dispensed.

Especially after hearing so many horror stories.. but after doing lots of research and reading a few reviews on the actual site I decided to go ahead with it. Got my package today. Was shipped from New Jersey. Ordered it on a Thursday night and the dress arrived on Tuesday by UPS. Beautifully and carefully wrapped. Dress came on a hanger and wrapped in plastic! Fun little thank you note inside.  Dress looks just like the pictures and fits true to sizes on size chart! It\\'s so soft! I\\'m thoroughly pleased! Will definitely be ordering from simplydresses.com again!\\n\\nI\\'d also like to add.. this is a 100% unbiased review. I was not compensated in any way to post this.

She made great suggestions and answered all my off the wall need to know it all questions with confidence and professionalism. I believe this girl needs a round of applause!

Also commissioned some custom work which Saatchi facilitated.  It turned out great too.\\nGreat place to find stuff you need and fast shipping\\nThese guys do all the footwork of finding tickets, and give you great results.\\nJenson has a lot of eye catching bike accessories.  Accessories that, perhaps, you had not considered before spotting them on the website.  Such was my experience.  I visited the site expecting to purchase tire tubes and a tube repair kit.  When my visit to the site was over, not only had I purchased the tubes and repair kit, but also a set of sporty fenders that I found difficult to resist.  JENSON IS BIKE PEOPLE!\\nI  was not exactly sure which A/C blower motor I needed so I called Dyers (2006 Monaco Dynasty with two 15K Dometic/Penguin heat pump units). Their technical sales people made sure the motor I needed was the one they sold me. It was delivered fast and with the included installation instructions which were easy to follow, it probably took about 2 1/2 hours from start to finish to remove the old and install the new. It works great and is nice and quite - thanks Dyers!\\nWide range of products, easy ordering & payment.\\nSeamless transaction\\nWe had the most amazing event because of the entertainment. I just plugged into GigMasters and got so many offers from talented, colorful performers. The hardest part was trying to pick which two I could hire. They all respected my budget and were responsive to all emails and phone calls. I have shared this site with many people and appreciate how easy it was to plan our celebration in a very short period of time. Nearly 200 hundred people for dinner. A great time was had by all!!\\r\\nThank you\\nI appreciated her taking her time and explaining what would work best for my medical issues.\\nHe Was GREAT and Very Helpful!\\nWebsite easy to use and the flowers are beautifully packaged and delivered as scheduled!\\nI have ordered two items so far, its pieces that you cant find anywhere else.

Great table (oval, walnut top, white base).\\nAmerican Frame has a wide selection of frames in wood and metal, and some unusual colors in metal. I appreciated being able to get some sample pieces so that I could be sure which color worked best with my artwork and walls. I think it\\'s great that you can get a kit -- frame, acrylic, and backing board -- for any size you order; that simplifies things and it\\'s much easier than having to buy each piece separately. And they even sent a print catalog with my order! The frames went together quickly, and look great. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe only surprise was that hanging wire didn\\'t come with the kit, but these frames weren\\'t going to be hanged with wire anyway.\\nI was thrilled to find an online store with free shipping that had NOW organic hot chocolate.

Just what I was looking for!\\nI bought a new Bvlgari watch for my wife at Jomashop. It\\'s brand new, except that the time was running way too fast for an automatic watch. It was running like 5 mins fast every hour. Given how unreliable the customer service is based on reviews and experience (online agent not very polite), I took it to a reputable local watch store for repair without even trying to communicate to Jomashop. The store claimed that the watch probably had an impact that caused the spring wheel to twist. It was a $100 fix, and fortunately, it\\'s not more than that. Given how cheap the watches and how unreliable customer service are at Jomashop, I believe it\\'s a good idea to buy watches from Jomashop but serviced somewhere else.\\nFirst time user,but easy to get around the site.price ok\\nQuick delivery, Good quality\\nVery good to work with\\nVery courteous and quick to ship!\\nPart fit great arrived quickly will order from this company again!\\nI have used First in the Sky many times for business or first class airline seats.

I would recommend their service to anyone seeking a lower fare for business or first class airline travel.\\nMy band Stayne Thee Angel has used Disk Makers for both of our albums and could not be happier with the product and service.

I have never experienced a problem with this company and they have always been willing to work with me.  I have contacted them more than once to extend my payment and they have always been willing to assist.  I have never encountered a rude or disrespectful individual since I have dealt with this company, and, their prices are competitive or better than many companies offering short term installment loans.  \\nGood Job ACE\\nLinda Hankston, Houston, Texas\\nEasy breezy!\\nyou always get your order, but they\\'re slow\\nI’ve ordered a couch and dining chairs from Rove Concepts.

My 4 dogs and 4 cats enjoy your products everyday.\\nI spent over an hour walking around NYC trying to find where to board the bus...even after getting direction 3Xs from people who should know the area (policemen in patrol car, garbage man, an commercial vehicle parking garage). The street address in the email sent out is not quiet accruate either. I had to call you, Go Bus, and speak to a customer service rep, who help find the bus. The bus pass me as I had gotten close which also help me to find it but once do I got there, the bus driver was very abrupt and rude. I walk up to the bus as the driver was coming off the bus and before I could ask him anything, he just walk off the bus and past me saying (with poor english), \"too soon bus.\" I turned to asked him another question, saying excuse me, sir...sir...excuse! He kept walking and ignored me. I repeated myself saying the same words a little louder in case he did not me but he kept on walking. It was first time riding the bus. Not the best experience if you hold any importance to word of mouth...for obvious reasons. The ride itself and the fact I got to my finally destination early after a horrible experience because of the bad Nor\\'easter storm that hit the area in the form of heavy rain and wind left me stranded in NYC at the airport with no place to stay and an exceptionally large smount of money for a Urber to a noisy little sleepless night at an Airbnb. The the bus was my only alternative way home. My seat was not clean either. So yeah...there\\'s allllll of that. Side note: if you consider rethinking the first bus departure schedule for the bus that leave NYC to BOS so it coordinate with first Long Island Long Beach train arriving at Penn station, that would be nice too. I was in a panic trying to get back to Boston for work after all other form of transport was either canceled, sold out or not running to get from point A to B. Thanks\\nI love the outfits, accessories, pretty much all the styles and products offered however it is frustrating when most of the apparel I want to buy is out of stock in the color I want or size I need. I run into this problem everytime I shop on most of the things I want so that is why I reduced the star rating by one star. The quality of nearly everything I have purchased is great and the sizing is normally spot on.\\nOrdered on line. Easy to do. Whole process went well.\\nI have placed orders with them multiple times over the phone. They are always very courteous and quick to answer. Their staff know the products well and can make confident, knowledgeable recommendations.

They over-delivered - getting our passports back to us almost 5 days ahead of the promised date (they don\\'t really control all parts of this process, so don\\'t count on it).  Vacation was saved.

Will be ordering again in the future !\\nI\\'ve been using Priceline since it came on the scene years ago.  It doesn\\'t have the \"me too\" feeling like all the other travel sites rehashing the same data.   Their Express Deals in particular REALLY ARE DEALS.  I typically get a 3 or 4 star hotel, and am ALWAYS more than satisfied with the property.\\nEasy to find what I wanted.\\nThis place is so clean. I recommend it.\\nIn my opinion Thrift Books is a pretty good site. My only complaint is that the description of the books I ordered are not very accurate. All of the hard cover books that I ordered said nothing about how the books I ordered didn\\'t come with slip covers. I was pretty disappointed by that. But other than that I think the website is pretty awesome.\\nGot my parts very fast 7 i am happy with them. Will use parts geek again then next time I need parts for my vehicle.\\nMy experience was A+\\nThis is a preliminary review as I am still in the Medical Billing Specialist program, but the videos are not well organized, the slides have typos and the pictures in slides aren\\'t clear to see and often not relative. The woman in the videos is so redundant, often saying the same thing three different ways in a matter of minutes. The videos make mention of terminology that is never spelled or is not even a vocabulary word, which I find ridiculous.  This is an anatomy class and if you are going to talk about it don\\'t assume the learner knows anything about what it is that you are saying. The book is not helpful at all. At the end of the chapter there are vocabulary words and next to them pages where the word was discussed. Well when you go to that page you simply find the word with a line next to it where a definition is to be inserted. Basically, they never define the word.\\n\\nI am highly disappointed and find it hard to even get motivated to work through this program. It is torturous to me.\\nFound the rates on just fly cheapest.  Booking was a breeze!!

Clicking on a card on the left offered options for the card across on the right.  \\n\\nTodays credit card rates by credit, feature & issuer are great options.  Being able to select & then select a form interest is well done.  It being live gives your viewers the opportunity to check our changing rates daily.  \\n\\nI think cardrates.com will be a valuable tool for clients searching for a credit card w/ certain reward options that fit their needs.  This has been a tool in need for years well done.  Many want the frequent flyer miles especially w/ many corporations now forcing their employees to travel on their own credit cards & being reimbursed by expense reports.  \\nTodays technology from ebates to coupons on line. If suppliers want to pull traffic to their website you have to make it worth the click.  \\nWell done I think you hit your target...Good Luck.    \\n\\n**attention** top bar cardrates.com right side*** both advice & news gives an internal server error.***Reviews had a drop down & no error. *************\\nGreat sweatshirt, sizing correct, came earlier than expected\\nFirst time buyer with these guys.

I have looked elsewhere and found businesses no farther away than the ones on Angie\\'s list with positive results.\\nThey have great sales, great clothes and great delivery time.\\nService is great. Prices are reasonable. Auctions are fun. Items are almost always described and graded accurately. For some reason, I have gotten several comics from Lone Star where one of the bottom corners of the book is bent. Like they were dropped somewhere along the line either when being put into their inventory or packing to be shipped out.\\nI came across A4C looking for a Apple replacement cable.

Me, and two of my friends decided to take our daughters to New York for their 16th birthday.  I came upon the New York Pass while Googling things to do in New York.

Just fly gave me plenty of options and confirmed my flights in just minutes.\\nMost of the time, when you book ticket through other websites like orbitz, kayak, flyjet etc... they charge you 100$ to 150$ per ticket when you cancel OR change flight in addition to airline fees. But Vayama, for extra $10 per booking, you will NOT pay any of such extra fees, other than what airline will charge you....\\nMade call to booking agent to seek personal help needed to join some friends on a flight they had already booked round trip to Asia from America.

When the grill was put on backorder they gave me a credit for my inconvenience.   Would buy from them again.\\nBought a MAF sensor, paid $330.25 on my visa, Part delivered to me damaged, emailed 6-7 time for help, no reply except for automated response. Tried calling 5-6 times stayed on hold for over an hour, and was finally disconnected. Bank returned my money, so PartsGeek.com can go Screw themselves.

Still haven\\'t spoken to one yet. \\nWhen finally arrived. They left on curb. Unbelievable. Had to hire local kids to bring into my house and assemble.  They lie and mislead you.

Most survey sites don\\'t do this. These other sites are frustrating as I usually don\\'t qualify for any of their surveys. It is a waste of my time taking these other surveys.\\nBy far my favourite T-shirt shop!\\nLove it!! Would recommend to anyone.\\nHave bought different pens and other items several times from National Pen. Have always been pleased except for one time and they took care of problem immediately.

Pages were falling out, & some pages were already missing.\\nFrom initial order to installation... everything went very well and our mirror looks fantastic.\\nGreat product Great price. Been using for over 14 years\\nShipping was fast - everything fit well. I ordered two shirts and two bumper stickers - one of which I designed.  The site was easy to use.  I had no issues getting the items quickly.  My only reservation is that when I went back to find one of the shirts, it was gone.  So I couldn\\'t order another or if a friend wanted one they couldn\\'t have ordered another.  I haven\\'t done research so I don\\'t know how long they keep things up on their site.  Other than that - the experience was great.  I\\'m sure I will order more things from them in the future.\\nGreat!

Keeping this website for all my future classes. So excited to actually sell my books back! Thanks!\\nService was exceptional from the shuttle driver to the front desk. We asked for and got a room with a roll-in shower, but it was so far down the hall, it was a struggle\\n And although the room was clean, it was very poorly lit.

Made me feel comfortable about talking about my finances.\\nI\\'ve used KV Supply for years and always come back to them.\\nI purchased 2 balloon bouquets and a flower bouquet for my mother across country when I found out she was admitted for and emergency surgery. It was the least I could do considering my husband and I are stationed with the military in .CA and my mother was in NC. Balloons were perfect, the flowers appeared nothing like the bouquet I ordered. So of course I contacted the customer service line, after sending pictures of the bouquet my mother received and going back and forth all day, I was finally told it was going to be made right and that my mother would receive a bouquet the following day that appeared more like what I ordered, so the next morning my mother received it and guess what still appeared nothing like what I ordered as far as the colors the bouquet was supposed to be. So I contacted customer service again, sent another picture, mind you up until this point everyone I had spoken to had been so understanding and polite. I went on about my day, while at a class with my son received a voicemail telling me they were more than likely not going to refund my money after the second flower delivery attempt but that I could call back to discuss the situation, so i called to speak with the young lady who had just left me a voicemail. Well the phone was answered but I never got a hi how are you today or anything of that nature but rather over heard the young lady who had just left me a voicemail and a gentleman discussing the emails I had sent and laughing about my request to refund my flower purchase because it was not delivered properly 2 days in a row. They were mocking the situation, I said hello many times this occurred for about 3 to 4 minutes, finally I hung up and called back and asked for a manager or supervisor, turns out the young lady who had left me a voicemail was in fact the person mocking and attempting to make a fool out of me, and the gentleman who was with her I was told was the owner. I was furious at this point, I told the girl how I felt and that what they had done was very unprofessional and disrespectful. We spoke for a good 25 minutes going back and forth and finally made peace with the situation, apologized to each other and she told me to give it 2 to 3 days and that our flower purchase would be refunded. So again I continue on about my day when all of the sudden I get a phone call from a .CA number, thinking it\\'s my son\\'s Dr. I answer, and a lady named Cynthia with the company was on the other end, yelling at me and being incredibly disprespcrful to me about a situation I thought had already been resolved, upon her yelling and rudeness I asked he why she felt the need to call and yell at me when she wasn\\'t even completely sure of the situation at hand which she then responded that I needed help and she hung up on me. I was in awe and shock. How amazing it was that this company is in the business of lifting individuals spirits when their families have loved ones in hospitals, to be treated with such rude disrespectful behavior makes me feel as if they are unworthy of the money their customers pay them to have a job. I did reconnect with the customer service line and speak to the so called owner, he said he was going to use this situation as a teachable moment for his team and I hope that is true because no one should have to go through the same situation as me. Needless to say, I will no longer use this business in the future.\\nGreat service quality is awesome\\nAnessa & Alex were awesome to work with and made the process so easy and a wonderful experience.\\n\\nWould use Q&L again for the next time, if there is a next time.\\nThis tee shirt was a Father\\'s Day gift and even though it arrived a little late(my fault), it was perfect.

Thanks\\nTerrible customer service.  Misleading insurance costs.  Awful experience.\\n\\nI bought a ticket from Los Angeles to Addis Abbaba Ethiopia. \\n\\nI have to more people coming and but need to fly out the next day from New York.\\n\\nI asked to change the ticket and the change ticket fee is $350. \\n\\nBut if I cancel the ticket it’s $300 and the $100 of insurance doesn’t cover changing for this reason which was misleading.\\n\\nIt was cheaper to cancel the ticket and buy a new ticket.  I was ready to buy two additional tickets as well.\\n\\nSo then I decide to cancel. However the customer service person couldn’t not give me a veirificafion of cancellation. I spent 45 minutes on the phone waiting to get an email verifying that my flight was cancelled, that I would be charged $300 and get the rest refunded to me.\\n\\nOn top of that the refund won’t post to my account for 45 days. With no reasonable explanation for that. It takes you minutes to take money from my card but 45 days to reimburse me?\\n\\nSo I could have bought 2 additional tickets and you could have given me a reasonable change fee and reimbursed me at a reasonable amount of time but instead it was a terrible experience and I hope no one else goes through it.\\n\\nAfter I got of the phone I bought three tickets to Ethiopia from New York.\\n\\nI was also treated like I was unreasonable for wanting proof of a cancellation and that my refund would come back.\\n\\nThis is a one star booking service until you can offer a better remedy and solution.\\n\\nThank you,\\nGus\\neasy to install and looks great\\nThis is the third time we have rented through AVR.

Also, I noticed imediatly after booking and room was scheduled a month out. They lead me to believe I was speaking directly to the hotel I was trying to book. SCAM ALERT!!!!!!\\nI enjoy doing business with MyComicShop because I am able to sell the comics I no longer want to get the comics I do want!

Has lasted longer than other cartridge that I have purchased.  Good quality!\\nI flew from California to Peru, then from Peru to Florida.  Travelocity routed me from San Diego to Houston to Mexico City to Lima, and then from Lima to Miami.  After I purchased the non-refundable tickets, I discovered that Jet Blue has direct non-stop flights from LAX to Lima and from Lima to Fort Lauderdale, for hundreds of dollars less than I paid.  Since Travelocity charges a booking fee, there is no reason for them to exclude discount airlines from their search.  Thanks a lot, Travelocity.  :(\\nThe team of Hubert and Ron was excellent and thorough.  They stayed until the job was done and not by the clock.\\nThe suit room was too small and as well as breakfast room. Breakfast was too poor.\\nfast shipping, well packaged, thank you.\\nI thought that the company was pretty fair on how they deal with there customers. I also think that they do a good job taking care them from the reviews that I read.\\nWe have lived here going on 6 years.  Twice we have been \"attacked\" by what I call the \"Security Rush Squad\".  It\\'s as if you open the door and WHOOSH!  several men run past you and go in different directions.  They have equipment in their hands and they start placing it where another security company has their equipment.  Then in a \"New York Minute\" another man has a paper and pen for you to sign, if you want to start a contract with them for security, using the equipment they just installed.  Luckily, Emanuel said \"yes\".  This happened twice.  Not a favorite tactic of ours now.  Then we missed ADT when they were in the neighborhood, so we called them back, as we had already discussed not dealing with Vector (we had an incident and weren\\'t pleased with the way they dealt with it.}\\nthe service from frank and sarah finishing it up great\\nVery Good!

The check-out was a good experience. I liked the 50% off for a few hours. Also the dimensions chart for S, M, L, or XL, was very useful because these things are different in other companies.

We contacted Optima and they stepped in and handled the issue with a professionalism that is hardly ever seen today.  We were able to talk with real people whenever we wanted and they kept us up to date with each step.  Contact with the IRS was limited to normal notices with none of those threats of collections or other actions.  Our issue was solved in a manner way better than we expected.\\nthe parts seem to be as good as oem.\\nLike I said,  the price of the products I ordered were great, quality not so much....I have a creaky ball joint on an upper control arm in my acura TL \\'03, 2-3 months after it was replaced with a partsgeek part....In reading much of their disclaimers it seems the are fine with selling cheap parts just not backing up what they sell.....Customer service is non existent......you have to email a ticket in for any kind of a response that \"usually takes 24 - 48 hours\"....not what I want to deal with when I have a complaint and want to talk to someone about a resolution....On the off chance that I might get someone on the phone I spent about 1/2 an hour on hold listening to the same crappy music and no one ever answered, my feeling was that no one would and I\\'d still be on hold at this very moment....In all they\\'ve lost my business and I\\'ll buy parts elsewhere.\\nBumpy start, Customer oriented, smooth finish, will book again\\nOrder a camera set, when it was deliver the memory card did not work.

The service has been very reliable, with speeds as promised.  There may have been a few instances of interruption during large monsoon storms, but I consider that minimal.  If only the local telephone and electric providers could be this dependable.\\nIf I could leave a minus star review, I would do that. I ordered 3 items online and returned them to the store because they were too small.  They reduced my return amount by $20, then gave me a Kohl’s cash coupon for $20 good for that day only.  I will NEVER buy from Kohl’s again and will stop all ads and contact from them.  Lesson learned.\\nFound item I needed but shipping is a bit high.

Seriously, when it comes to Christmas presents, Gettington.com has been a LIFE SAVER.\\nFeel like being cheated\\n\\nI started with Rebtel last month on a trial period and signed up for their $10/month for unlimited calls to India. Just now I tried calling a friend and there was an automated message that youve reached the max limit of unique numbers you could call. ARE YOU SERIOUS? I bought this thing so that I could make non commerical calls to family and friends back in India. Why would you restrict this to a few numbers. Whatever dumb person in your company has made this decision let them know that Indians have wider social group and we are a community oriented group. If you dont fix my account to take this restriction off NOW, I am straight away disconnecting mine and three other similar connections. This aint worth it.\\nWe have a twelve mile paved trail near our house that runs along side a lake. I try to ride there at least twice a week. It has mild up and down  hills.

The pens look amazing. I almost don\\'t want to hand them. Looking forward to ordering with you guys again.\\nApart from the logo on the long sleeve T shirts, I felt that the shirts were average store bought quality but double if not more in price than comparable shirts on the market.  I realize the logo makes these shirts different but how much markup is needed to sell the product?  I would certainly have second thoughts before making further purchases.\\nAlways my go to!\\nAt check out I was asked to pay the total cost.  I had payed a \"down payment\" which was ignored.

Thanks Avas, you rock!\\nexcellent and fast service, good prices\\nTried to book a Santa for a holiday party, received 4-5 emails right away, most of which were booked, and I have no complaints about that. Had one quote sent and the price was right. Said i had about 2 days to accept the quote. When I went to book and pay, I received a confirmation and email that said we were good. A few minutes later received another email saying that Im sorry but we booked with someone else for that day and time. Very disappointing to say the least! Not sure I can blame gigsalad for this, but it would be nice to have functionality that provides updates so this type of confusion doesn\\'t happen again. I was told that I would receive a refund from the vendor, I\\'ll assume gigsalad will refund me my $15 usage fee as well.\\nThe remote worked great and the shipping was fast, price was good.

I love Mr.Suppz\\nI was really surprised to find these new on clearance. I have no doubt that I was the first one to play the 5th Dimension single from 1970. The unadvertised ELO pic sleeve was a great bonus. Vinyl singles from the 90s at such a low price? Blows my mind. Very satisfied with my first purchase. The packaging was perfect and shipped fast. I like the catalogs as extra padding...felt like I was opening a package from an old skool music club. I\\'ll definitely be shopping again soon.\\nMost transaction can be tracked automatically.  Even if transaction are not tracked still could submit a trace form manually.  And most of the transaction has cashback promptly.  It is worth the extra step while doing the online shopping.\\nI would rate Phone Power as 5 stars except for my problems getting E911 to work. It took about 6 support calls and multiple tests. I got a different answer/suggestion each time. I am experienced with VOIP, so I knew the problem was address look-up on the E911 database. The real problem(s) that the phonepower website would not allow me to correctly enter the address. Finally I was handed over to the billing department. They changed the billing address which is the default E911 address. It worked. The website is otherwise very slick (good), it simply would not let me enter the correct street suffix and city name/zip.\\nI purchased the styllus pens for marketing to customers, they look awesome!!!!!!\\nSame contacts I got from my optometrist or SamsClub or wherever, but a lot less money.\\nthere when i needed them\\nExactly as expected\\nI received my order on the time I\\'ve expected and it arrived in perfect conditions!\\r\\n\\r\\nthank you\\nExtremely comuniticave!\\nWe are very satisfied with our new furniture.\\nOur Progressive Dinner team building event was fantastic.  It was not exactly what we had planned due to the fact that the restaurant said it would be too difficult for the waiters to serve the dinner if we moved around. However, the facilitator and his assistants did a fantastic job in adjusting the activity and kept all of us right on time.  The activities they had for us were a lot of fun and very engaging for the entire group.  This group is very competitive, so that made it even that much better.  There was lots of laughter all evening.\\nGot the best deal out there - online.  \\n\\nTo be fair I have not picked up the car yet - next month - but I hope the rest of the service will be of equal rating.\\nIt was easy and pain free through the whole process.\\nVenkata\\nMy reservation was fast and easy.

Thank you JustFly for the quick and easy reservation.\\nI\\'m always delighted with Bluestone Perrenials.\\nAdt communication & service was beyond my expectations!\\nI make several purchases from Afloral per week. This 3 star rating is for the real touch peony bouquet I purchased. 3 tiny flowers and one tiny bud for $20.00 plus shipping - these flowers are terrible. Very unpleased with that particular purchase.\\n\\nI would rate my other purchases with 4 to 5 stars.\\nWe have had Dental plans for many years as now, We keep it because our long time dentists accepted it, however, I was looking for a dentist for my parents and many of other dentist that show on the members list do not accept this discount plan, perhaps many businesses were closed to the public.\\nThe book I ordered (Doctrines of Salvation) was describe as being all 3 volumes of the set compiled in one book, but what I received was volume 1 only. Is the seller planning to send the other 2 volumes separately or continue their deceitful descriptions regarding their merchandise?\\nFrom the beginning, the broker selling the boat was slow to respond to requests for info, pics, etc. When we actually set up a time to view and inspect the boat, I inquired if we could do the closing the same day if the boat was acceptable, as it was a 6 hour trip to get to the boat, and I wanted to avoid making this trip twice just to sign my name and hook up to the boat. Broker said twice it wasn\\'t possible to close on the same day, then the morning of said maybe it was possible....back and forth. After we saw the boat and we\\'re waiting (again) to hear from the broker about closing, I went around him and spoke to the closing coordinator, who actually new what she was doing and said it would be no problem to close same day (apparently the broker had no idea of this.) We also wasted about 1.5 hours because the broker didn\\'t make an effort to have the boat delivered to the closing office as we requested- which instead causes us to travel out of our way twice when we didn\\'t need to. There was no customer service from the broker- nothing was done by him to make the process as seamless as possible. I feel he didn\\'t have any experience in sales or in customer service. We were able to close the same day, which is not the norm for this company. With a different broker I would give them another shot.\\nI was supposed to have a credit for two returns that was not applied\\njust follow the steps  very simple\\nSuper easy and well thought out process. \\nMuch appreciated was the ease with which I could buy trip insurance.\\nI work for a general contractor and we were preparing some marketing materials for an upcoming conference, and knew we needed something to give to potential clients.  We found Flashbay online and contacted them about helping us.  They had several products to choose from, along with assigning Ryan Joyal to help us through this process.  Ryan was great and provided great communication and a quick turn around.  We selected the product, submitted the artwork and what we wanted printed (we went with 16gb jump drives).  Ryan quickly prepared a draft for approval and was able to begin having the order processed.  We started process on a Thursday morning, approval by early afternoon, payment in the afternoon (was real easy to submit payment), and I received the product by Tuesday the following week, which was pretty good in my opinion, especially over a holiday weekend.  This was a fast, easy, and pleasant transaction.  Ryan\\'s communication and support was great.  We will definitely look to Ryan and Flashbay for our future needs.\\r\\nThank you,\\r\\nLeo Hanley\\nI would rather read a real book than read e-books. So glad there is still someplace to purchase them.

I try to practice as much hope as possible and went for the 30...  I did end up getting a right hip rreplacement,  the 6 month evaluation, showed the hip worsening.  I also used Regenexx clinic for my back problems and it helped 100%...and my right ankle..which helped 90%.\\n  I can\\'t say enough about their honesty and dedication, and am truly grateful, I went there first before i had the replacement or else I wouldn\\'t be as peaceful about my situation which I did NOT want to do!!!\\nPerfect fit,not that hard of a job.Huge improvement for tired original,much more comfortable on long trips now.\\nGreat service and timely shipping!\\nI am satisfied with your service.

I was disappointed because I could not use a coupon on the order due to the amount. I was also surprised that the checks did not come in a box - I guess that helps to keep the overall cost with shipping to minimum.\\nWe looked all over the web for this hair spray, good company to purchase from.

If you are not interested to some attraction, don\\'t worry in most case, you can choose within different options. we really  enjoyed everything, especially top of the rock with an incredible view of the city and the cruise on the Hudson river.\\nBooked a flight and paid for checked in luggage. When I arrived at the airport I was informed there was no checked in luggage paid for, therefore had to dish out an additional 10,000 yen to process my luggage. Disappointed with the service given I had already paid for luggage to be checked in and now expect I will have the same issue with my connecting flight.\\nLove it but I skip months at a time waiting for just the right thing. Bad things: no sale items count for my VIP credits, sizing varies so it is hard to get the right fit!\\nVery easy process and my niece loved her gift!\\nBeen using WallyPark for years without issues.

Completely explained the repairs that were needed and gave me a great price on shocks, tires, alignment and oil change for the company Toyota pick up. American Tire Depot also put new tires on my Dodge Challenger SRT.\\nGreat customer service.\\nI am especially fond of the Sport Strap, which is great for keeping the strap in place while shooting. I also use the double strap for event work and enjoy the comfort and performance it provides. The price point is right and is a great value for the money. I also like the thoughtful accessories one can use with the straps like the Lockstar, that keeps the ConnectR lock securely in place so there are no accidental detachments of the camera from the straps. I also like the Protectr that has a metal wire that prevents the strap from being cut by a thief, who could otherwise steal one\\'s camera if not alert. Get this accessory for each strap!\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to using BlackRapid straps, I used similar straps from a well known German company in the camera strap world. Both are very good and have their merits and room for improvement.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have had a chance to use both brands enough to make a fair comparison from a professional point of view. The BlackRapid straps are lighter and just as comfortable as their German counterparts, which is great for long events wearing two heavy cameras and are more easily managed when transporting them. BlackRapid has a nicer price point.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only criticism I have with the BlackRapid system is the connector plate that affixes to the camera. I would prefer a connector plate that rotates in such a fashion that does not allow for it to loosen up under any circumstance. I am the king of over torquing things, but found myself having to re-tighten the connector plate several times, in spite of the design with the carabiner. I realize this may not be a problem for some, but I use 2 Canon 5d Mark IIIs with battery grips and a 70-200mm on one camera with the dual strap ( attach the strap to the lens in this case), so they are heavy as camera rigs go and I don\\'t like the distraction of re-tightening connector plates for fear of a camera becoming detached. That said, BlackRapid is innovative, which I love, so I would love to see this addressed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, save for my only real concern mentioned above,  the BlackRapid products I own are first-class and are a joy to use. I would recommend their products to anyone looking for a great camera strap or harness.\\nGreat Company, quick shipping and product was as described. Thanks!\\nI have purchased two of these urns. They are well constructed. I recommend them.\\nUnable to contact company through either email(s) (no response) or their toll free number. Trying to return an item.

Much easier than parking at the airport and lugging bags to and from long term parking.\\nvery nice watch and honnest price\\nI ordered the expensive product with expedited shipping for a birthday present for my 10 year old son.  Two days later they contacted me saying they had to confirm my order due to security reasons because my shipping and billing address were different. I have regularly ordered from sites with a different shipping and billing addresses and have never run across this issue.  This chewed up 2 days.  They assured me that they would overnight the product so that it would arrive by the birthday on Friday.  When I received the tracking info it said it would arrive by Monday.  When we finally did get the delivery, it was the WRONG product!!!!  After all of that my son had to wait even longer to get his gift! So disappointing.  They did credit the shipping and gave me a measly 10% off of my order and still expected me to send the wrongly ordered product back to them.  I think better customer service would have been to suggest I keep the other item rather than dealing with the hassle of sending back something that was their mistake.\\nEasy to get on, quick trip, would do again.\\nAgoda easy to find hotel for your trip\\nVery fast shipping. Great experience. Great value and products\\nVery good and cheap store with lots of action. I recommend to everyone.\\nGregory was so helpful !

I would venture to say that I am very pleased and cannot wait to see what happens with the mushroom products that I am now taking.\\nHad a bad experience with another company and wanted to make sure I was with a company I could trust.\\nI went with SquareTrade because they allow repairs to be done at the Apple Store. Anyone who has used aftermarket parts on Apple products know they are sub-par and break easily. So my first claim at SquareTrade and they refused to cover my repair at an Apple Store.\\n\\nI called their sales line again to pretend I needed to cover my iPad and they said I absolutely can repair it at an Apple Store. Got transferred over again and they refused again. Managers refused as well. So I had to lose my iPad that I use every day and use it to fly as a pilot for an entire week when I could have walked down the block to an Apple Store and got it repaired the same day with OEM parts. Now my iPad has aftermarket parts with lower quality. \\n\\nSquareTrade Lies!!!  Will never use them again.\\nGreat products and smooth return process for an item that I incorrectly ordered!\\nIt has been a month since I ordered this picture.

I ordered through Norwegian, car from Hertz, perfect from order to deliver, but maybe CarTrawler is a company in backhand , don\\'t know, but I got what I ordered, 100%.\\nExcellent customer services and happy to be with Kin Insurance\\nI have order multiple items from them never had any issues with product or shipping. Simple and easy.\\nSuch an easy experience! found a great trip at a great price!\\nNo problems - smooth experience at both ends of my trip.\\nIve been using VRBO through the years and I’ve just listed my house on Home Away and I’m excited to welcome my first guests soon!\\nDO NOT BUY THE FULL COVER!! IT IS WORTHLESS AND YOU WILL BE CHARGED TWICE!!!! I bought the so-called ‘peace of mind’ full insurance protection for £64. Got to the Goldcar counter in Mallorca and they flat-out refused to accept it and charged me another €69, saying they didn’t recognise it. I will be complaining and will never use this company again!!\\n\\nUpdate in response to somewhat passive-aggressive response from Rentalcars:\\n\\n1. I showed them the paperwork and they said it didn’t provide full cover. \\n2. Their insurance was not ‘optional’, meaning I had to pay it or would not be allowed to hire the car. \\n3. This charge was not a ‘deposit’ and was non-refundable. \\n\\nIn short, rentalcars are a shady business using deceptive tactics (no running tally of the price as you proceed through the process?) and you will probably be ripped off and then encounter a useless response such as the below WITHOUT ANY OFFER TO RESOLVE I might add. \\n\\nUse a price comparison site and then book directly with the hire company. Avoid these cowboys.\\nWe needed to get life insurance before my wife and I retire; our insurance had been through work. I did some shopping on my own, then I heard the Select Quote commercial on Sunday morning. I logged in, entered some basic info, and the next day David Trevino called. We had much in common despite the difference in age, and he gave me the numbers. I tried to find a better deal for each of us, but I could not! I called him back, we did the deal and it was exactly as advertised. We are very pleased, and I am very happy that David is my agent!

I called and a very helpful woman said that antique silver does have a gold tone to it and that that was the frame I ordered.  But she offered to take them back at no cost to me, except my shipping them, even though they had been custom cut.  I ended up being able to use them on two other paintings in the same series.  She was patient and helpful.\\nGreat prices and helpful!\\nFirst time I used the Careington discount and it was painless (literally).

The technology and the idea of this is truly amazing. My only issue is simply geographical. I live in a small town and own a small corner lot. Until they get to a point where you can shrink the radius down, this is more built for people with a large plot of land. It updates position every 12 minutes, I wish it signaled you the moment the it left the whistle zone. That\\'s really my only gripe, but I\\'d definitely recommend this to anyone that has a dog that enjoys freedom, but loves to wander.\\n2nd time used in Europe Great\\nThe price was great, I got the correct part, fast shipping, could not be happier\\nI would recommend this company to anyone\\nThe search function needs to be expanded.

The price is great for a year and I am going to use this for so many things!!!! I am so excited! Thank you Smilebox for making my life easier to share and create things for my family and friends!\\nUPDATE: \\r\\nPlease see the response from Skin Spa below, THERE IS NOTHING IN THE EMAIL CONFIRMING CASH TIP. If I could upload a photo I would, but nope. I went over the offer email, the confirmation email, the follow up email....nowhere. So before you respond incorrectly to try and feign interest, like you are actively aware of your customers, speak the truth. \\r\\n\\r\\nAlso - please be honest about why you stopped credit card tipping - it is to save YOU taxes...no other reason. Even the checkout guy admitted that to me, as would anyone. I don\\'t care that much, until you responded with complete dishonesty - don\\'t you understand most customers just want the truth? \\r\\n\\r\\nI also stopped going there because you lost all the decent massage therapists to other places because you were terrible to work for. I know this time she straight out of school, so I won\\'t be surprised when she is gone in a few months. \\r\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\nMy massage was great!!! the massage therapist was amazing, and very nice. When i go to checkout I find out they don\\'t allow tips on the credit card (they used to, so this was new to me). since I live around the corner I had gone with just my phone and credit card, not my atm card, and told him I didn\\'t have an atm card on me. He proceeded to chastise me and tell me it was \"CLEARLY written in all emails and appointment reminders\" I looked at all my emails and appt reminders, it was NOWHERE to be found. I pointed that out to him, he said \"oh, well, I will be sure to let my general manager know\" and then I found a $5 I had and said, at least I can leave this until I can come back with cash. He said \"Well, at leasst it is sooooommmmething\"  - sorry YOU failed to make your policy known ahead of time\\nVince was awesome in guiding us through our process and answering all of our questions.

It said 2-4 days for shipping.  I waited almost 2 weeks, opened the box and it looked sketchy, it was brown amd rusted a little bit.   I googled the part and it said it was for a 2006 chevy malibu. I thought well maybe this is just another part thats the same (some parts are the same kind as the malibu) so i had my mechanic put the part in. THE PART DID NOT WORK!!!!!   I am currently waiting to return it because they arent open on weekends.  Lets hope they stick to what they advertise and i get my $200 back...\\nMy questions and my order were handled efficiently.

It\\'s great!\\nGreat experience after a horrible one with Art Van.  Thanks much because I have been pleased from talking to Austin to the delivery of my furniture.  Your team did a great job keeping me updated and reminding me of delivery date and time.  I appreciate the effort put in to servicing me.  I definitely will be coming back to purchase again.\\nEasy access and affordable.\\ngreat company! will invoice the church....that was a great option because otherwise my husband and I would need to be paid back and that\\'s always a little annoying....thanks so much\\nThe products are very well made and in new conditions. Shiping timee was ok and the prices are fair.\\nI\\'ve been using the American Frame Company for a number of years to obtain framing and matting materials for my watercolor paintings. I\\'ve found their products to be of very high quality, and their service, either by telephone or online, excellent. Their website, onec you get the hang of it, is easy to use.\\r\\nI recommend them without hesitation\\nNice app,easy to use\\nProcess was simple and quick.  So far so good.\\nThis was a very easy and professional experience.  The web site was very user friendly and I was able to find or order the key in just a few clicks.  The key arrived in a few days.  I would highly recommend Easy Keys.\\nEfficient but I find all the different names puzzling (e.g. Autoreisen, Top Car, Rentalcars)\\nThe salesman was great.  \\n\\nI went in to buy an advertised sale item on Sunday and was told they were out.  The checked the system and said 2 were in the warehouse (1 had been sold earlier), but it would be at least a week.  If something was wrong with the 1, it would be 2 weeks to receive my purchase.  \\n\\nThe assistant store manager committed to calling me on Monday (yesterday) with an update, but I haven\\'t received that call yet.\\ndamn is real i got code steam nice\\nExcellent quality canvas..would do business with them again!\\nBest vacation and vacation rental experience I have ever had.  Thank you to Beau for  allowing us to rent his beautifully amazing property! Could not have gone any better! We will be back and we have already recommended buffalo cottage to several of our like minded, responsible friends! I just hope not too many of you vrbo-ers book it up so it will be available next time we want to go! Can\\'t go wrong staying here!\\nAfter struggling with local installers/repair folks with my water treatment system and then having very expensive issues every couple of months I was fed-up. I sent my water out for an independent lab test and sent the results to The Clean Water Store. They worked with me to redesign the filtration system while maintaining as much of my existing components as possible to save money. I installed the system myself and when I had an issue they talked me through it over the phone while sending me pictures to help on the visual. System worked great. A few years later when I encountered an issue they sent me parts at no cost. The system has been almost trouble free since 2009. This year I worked with the team to determine the best action and it was determined that all I needed to do is re-pack the filter with new media - again kept the cost way down. Thank you folks at Clean Water Store.\\nOrdered a tree in August or earlier. They said they would send it in November, and they did. I planted it and assume it will grow.\\nVery difficult to actually speak to an attorney in spite of that being one of their selling points. Mainly the office manager deals w questions. They also don\\'t take care of the required annual minutes/meeting for Trusts, which was another thing the touted. I\\'m actually afraid of the service I will receive from this group if I ever need to exercise the protection of the Trust.\\nFees were high. The company had hijacked the Google searches so I thought I was making a reservation directly with Hampton Inn. Instead it went through this company and 117.00 of charges were added. I was also told best rate for the room was 149.00 but when I called the hotel directly they told me it was 122.00. \\r\\n\\r\\nWill never use them again.\\ngreat prices high quality seed\\nI took a chance and bought the Plush Soft because of the reviews on their customer service as well as their mattresses. Unfortunately, even this mattress was too firm for me and they were wonderful. They had the delivery service come and remove the mattress and refunded all but the initial delivery fee as expected. We are moving out of the country so we knew that if the mattress was not for me we would not be taking it with us. \\n\\nEvery other vendor could learn from this. Try the mattresses! It was very well made and in pristine condition. I used a mattress protector and I kept it covered with a clean protector for the few days it took the delivery service to come get it. I wish they had one soft enough for me. I looked at Mattress Firm and the softest one in the store was $3600 for just the king mattress. So we will tolerate our old mattress and get a new one when we get to our new country. So sorry I could not keep the mattress. They deserve the business!\\nTheir price for Blue dog food is comparable to Petsmart. Instead of driving to Petsmart to buy a heavy bag of dog food, I now order from Petflow and orders over $49 have free shipping. With Petflow, it still costs about $1.00 more than if I were to go to Petsmart, however, I don\\'t think there is any tax AND I don\\'t have to pay for gas to get there. I think it evens out in the end, or quite possibly, it is cheaper to order from Petflow! Thanks, Petflow!\\nNo where else can I get these prices and if I find lower price, match a click away! Just google coupon codes for supplement warehouse and you\\'ll always find that months coupon. Great deals, fair shipping prices, and free stuff cant get better.\\nGreat deal!!!!\\nI don\\'t worry about my personally belongings because of the safety I the facility.  In addition, the employees care about their jobs and their customers.\\nItems are reasonably priced, as advertised and received in a very timely manner.\\nDisappointing! \\nI ordered a 40th Wedding Anniversary present for my parents and paid for the fast track delivery. My statues said it had been shipped on November 21st but by December 1st it had still not arrived. I have emailed the costumer center and am still awaiting a response. It is now December 8th and STILL no delivery. As you can imagine, I am very disappointed and have found your services quite frustrating.\\nI would definitely recommend to a friend.\\nThey got me the best rates and it was fats and easy\\nOutstanding service.  Great price.   Excellent staff at Boston Garden store.\\nLove looking forward to seeing what is inside my box every month...have never been disappointed!

I tipped him accordingly. When we returned from our vacation the driver stayed on the bus and we had to lift our luggage to him. when we arrived at your facility he again stayed on the bus and we had to take them from there. He was tipped accordingly.  We also had someone help us load our luggage into our vehicle. He was also tipped accordingly.  Last year when we used Wallypark for our vacation we received a bottle of water. This time we didn\\'t.  We will definitely use Wallypark again in when we go on next vacation.\\nWonderful experience start to finish. No complaints! Traveled to Ireland, total of 4 adults. Customer service was great at every point. Would definitely try again.\\nHow come your site is showing one price, i booked it, paid threw Paypal, and after 1 hour, you cancel it and say that there is no option to have this price anymore???\\r\\nalready made plans!\\r\\nhow is it possible to trust such a company?!\\r\\ni am demanding to compensate me! ot to have the same rate so i will not be needed to cancel my plans! \\r\\n\\r\\nLena\\nGreat team, fast paced, and friendly\\nWe have used American frame for several years in our photography.

It\\'s a great product.\\nVery quick and simple\\nThe process was simple and quick. The turn around time for funds available was within 24 hrs.

If there are two color options for an item, the boring black one will be the one available in a wider range of sizes, and the fun, cool one is the one that has a much more narrow range of sizes available.  I appreciate that they attempt to recognize more bodies, but we\\'re still withheld from some of the best stuff.  Most everything I want is only available to size XXL instead of 3X and so I have to settle for what I can find in my size.  I also find that fit, especially in bras and tops, could be way better, though I just bought the new zip-front bra they say has been designed for greater fit and comfort, so we\\'ll see!\\nRemitly is the fastest secured way of sending remittances.  Not to mention higher conversion rates and lowest service fee. Thank you remitly.\\nEverything was great except the $15 shipping fee and then noticing my flags started to tear after the first day of flying. The nylon that is claimed to be durable is not as durable as I would like.\\nOur organization has been doing business with Crystal Images for a while now and we always receive superior service.\\nthank you craig carter for professional excellent service\\nRead small print...people count on ur over look\\nAlexis gave the best customer service available at the Southfield store I would recommend that store to anyone that I know.\\nI bought an hp laptop, excellent product , price , and lightning fast shipping.\\nI found quality refills here for half the price of brand name.

Quick, accurate and the cost was right on.Thanks for a very efficient and economical company.\\nEasy to find the part, shipped fast, and good price and condition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only problem is that the turn signal \"assembly\" didn\\'t include the bulb socket itself, which is one of the key pieces that I needed to replace. It would have been nice if the part description or photo could have made that clear, but they didn\\'t.\\nI love this company. They have the specialty bulbs I need for my apartment.\\nI ordered and payed a computerbattery from usbphoneworld, but they send a wrong battery. They acknowledged the fault and promised to deliver a new one, Now 6 months later we still have not received our battery. \\r\\ntheir support team is very friendly and keep saying they will look into the matter, but the result still is no delivery. We have lost more than a 100 dollars dealing with this firm.\\nHelpful and curtious\\nThe card we chose was very easy to design & edit. And the processing & delivery were very quick & accurate. I would & have already sent others to your site.\\nI am an artist and worked in a custom framing gallery for many years. Since then I\\'ve been framing at home and have found American Frame to have great products and service. I love that I can order up to 5 free sample frame profiles with each order. It makes my process go smoothly. I\\'ve also had help with the reps when I\\'m confused about how to stack frames or add a liner. The two things I wish would change: 1) I use a point driver to secure my frames, but with every frame order I get a baggie with clips and screws. I end up tossing the clips and have a huge collection of screws. It\\'s very wasteful on their part. I wish I could have the option to have those included or not. 2) I like to float artwork on an uncut bottom mat and then have a top mat opening. In the order process you can\\'t order both an uncut mat and a cut mat. Instead I have to go to just the mat board section and select that particular color, cut to size. However the size has to be exactly perfect to what they trim it down to. An 8x10 isn\\'t always just that. But over all, I will continue to order products and I\\'m a satisfied customer.\\nGreat products. Great customer service!!!\\nMy first ink order came damaged. I called them and they fixed it right away. Within a couple days I had my new ink and it was perfect. I will continue to order my ink from them. Great customer service. Fast shipping. Good product. Thank you\\nVERY QUICK SERVICE AND ATTENTION TO MY REQUEST FOR A REPLACEMENT FOR A DAMAGED PREVIOUSLY FRAMED ART PIECE ORIGINALLY OBTAINED FROM AMERICAN FRAME. THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE EXCELLENT SERVICE.\\nGood rate. Easy to use\\nThe folders came out exactly the way we envisioned them. It was easy to order, easy to work with the designers and the delivery was super fast, faster than we expected! Highly recommend Folder Printers to anyone looking into having their materials have a professional finish.\\nI was very pleased with the car we used from Rentalcars & will definitely use them again. My only complaint is the 2 days after I booked I had an advertising email to say best rates ever & the rate I got when doing another quote was £2.00 cheaper than I had just paid. I now know to wait until the last minute to book, but till I got a very good deal, the best quote I could find the day I booked.\\nI ordered a necklace and was very excited to get it.  It was a very cheap necklace with no weight at all to it, and the picture \"printed\" on it was blurry and indecipherable.  When I reached out to customer service, they immediately refunded my money without requiring a return.  Though I definitely won\\'t purchase a necklace from Cafe press again, I will not hesitate to buy something else from them.  Great customer service.\\nfast & easy process.\\nWould recommend to others\\nUsing gigmasters took the search work out of it for me and made it so easy to find a DJ for my event. The bidding process was fast and easy.\\nI ordered bracelets with text. I received a proof in a format I couldn\\'t open and they sent me a PDF right away. Once I approved that, the bracelets were manufactured and shipped right away. I ordered 75 and received over 80 bracelets. i would order from this company again. I have also referred others to them for bracelets as well. Lots of choices.\\nOut of 14 cartridges that I ordered only one didn\\'t work. I haven\\'t called to see about this yet but honestly feel it won\\'t be a problem.\\nAll of the products that I have ordered are excellent, except one item that was defective. I contacted Groupon they responded quickly. So I am very happy with Groupon. Also pricing is great.\\nVery fast free shipping\\nBeautiful and unique, like a piece of art.  My New York daughter was blown away.\\nAs usual Thriftbook.com was an awesome experience. I use this site every time I order a book and I love it. I would not use any other book site.\\nSo far all is working well. Had one set back when I picked up my car from the service center and tried the interlock for the first time it did not work, the machine was damaged, however they install another one, and I was able to leave the service center a half hour later. I have not encountered any other issues at this time.\\nCame in as expected, in just three days out of the seven, although the box of my purchase aka the cover, the corners were bent, and i like my corners a full 90 degrees.\\nThe straight hair wig was nice, the curly wig curls are tight and no amount of combing helped to soften the curls, it was just a tight curl afro, nothing like the photo. The photo shows the curly hair falling nicely on the forehead of the model. Very disappointed. I cannot use. I give 3 stars because of fast delivery.\\nI would recommend this company\\nExcelent. Booking was done online quickley ans smoothly\\nGreat experience\\nEasy order, great product, delivered fast. informed me when it was delivered\\nThe Realmed Paper Tape was exactly what I wanted. It was well packaged and is truly hypoallergenic. Thanks\\nGreat service to the customers,  prompt response to an email inquiry and follow-up services.\\nworked well. easy to use\\nI\\'ve never dealt with such an unprofessional company. Paid a deposit for a stripper, with an agreed price. 3 days before we depart for our stag do, we get told we owe and extra €50 to what was agreed due to the exchange rate.\\n\\nI asked to confirm what date their exchange rate was taken and where it was taken from, but they have since ignored 2 email messages. They obviously tie you into this as you have paid your deposit. The show was also terrible, lasted 10 minutes if that.\\n\\nThey do not provide an address on there website, just a Cardiff telephone number.\\nVery easy to find great deals and value on products\\nThe price for the book was low, shipping was free, and the order was promptly filled.  There was also the option to track shipping.\\nI appreciate the ability to search for green power providers very quickly.\\nDefinitely a value, and I get to try the newest lures and bAits.\\nI had made a few orders in the past with no problems.  In the past I did not need anything shipped urgently, so I would use 2-3 day shipping.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThis last order that I made was a rush order so I paid the overnight delivery fee to get my products on time.  However,  It took them an extra day to ship the items.   They said that it was because I entered a PO Box on accident instead of my home and that it was an issue with Paypal.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIts not my fault that there is a paypal issue.  I relied on LED supply to be efficient and get the products out on time.  Overnight shipping almost doubled my order cost.  I was late on getting my product done and had a very disapointed client.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLED supply says it still not their fault and offered no compromise and stopped replying to me.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI will find another LED supplier to order from next time\\nI  ordered side mirrors for my Sentra. Gott\\'em in 3 days!!! Awesome! Thanks guys!\\nI get my cat food from Petflow.  It was very easy to set up automatic deliver on my time table.  Also, it was easy to edit my delivery date and how many lbs. of cat food, I would need.  The site was easy to navigate and I found what I was looking for.\\nVery good, does sometimes buffer when streaming but not as often as before, great customer service, setup is so easy your 99 year old Nan could do it with ease\\nThey were good. Very patient when it came Down to show how to activate the alarm. Now I have to member to show my wife how it works. They\\'re were cool. Mr. Thomas and his apprentice.\\njust recently bought macbook air and iPhone... and??\\r\\ni am alread head over the heel!!!\\r\\nthe unbelievable speed, the quality and the apps!!\\nI loved the pens. The color choice matched the picture. Most importantly the pens write smoothly. Who wants a prettty pen that doesn\\'t \\'work? The price was very reasonable also. I will be ordering more!\\ni use this website whenever i can. The sizing is usually accurate and the quality is good.\\nI ordered 36 Red Navel Oranges. When they arrived, 3 of the oranges were totally spoiled and mush. Another 7 were soft and quickly became spoiled. So, 10 out of 36 were not edible. I stored the oranges per Hales written pamphlet. Since then, a couple more have gone bad. I notified Hale the next day after they arrived. I did get a response asking me to provide them with the number that were bad/unacceptable.  I did that andI have not heard anything back from them at this time. Bad experience and poor service.\\nFreedom Debt Relief truly is amazing! Anyone who is considering debt relief should know it is a last effort to get out of debt. When minimum payments are too much to pay or when debt is overwhelming, I highly recommend Freedom Debt Relief. The staff is friendly and understanding. I knew my credit score would take a hit but also my credit was on the way down with my debt being so high. I enrolled $55,000 into Freedom Debt Relief and now I owe $42,000. When you see a settlement reached you can take a breath. Freedom Debt Relief has helped and is still helping me reach my dream of being debt free.\\nI ordered on 4/27 and today 5/15 in shipped on 5/13 a little strange to ship on a Sunday, I wish I would have got the e-mail that it had shipped. Not to happy with this order to say the least.\\nFresh, beautiful and artful arrangement delivered on time. What’s not to love? Thanks Gabriela!\\nI went in to get a hole plugged in my tire.  Upon review my tire was very worn and they felt I needed to replace it with a new tire.  Really wanted me to buy 2 tires, both fronts were bad.  I, financially, went in to plug a hole, and didn\\'t expect to walk out paying $107.00 for a tire, just one, I could not afford to buy 2.  That was not good, but the service was beyond excellent.  They took me in right away and took care of me with amazing care.  Thank you Town Fair Tire.\\nEasy to navigate\\nAlways satisfied with the process and the result.  But I received a sample for another employee that I didn\\'t order--and the name is spelled wrong on the pads.  Not sure why I received these samples, since I didn\\'t order them.  Other than that, the pads I did order came out great.\\nThis was an amazing course, love it!!\\nI first started doing this to make a few dollars and keep busy since I just retired, however; since I\\'ve started I realize just how important that this is! If you just fly though it you will not take anything away from it, but if you read it all you will get it just like I have. Keep them coming and please stay very interesting.\\nMy phone was sent in on a Monday early evening. I recieved it back at 9:30 am Wednesday morning. My phone looked great and everything worked perfectly. I will definitely use square trade for my future devices.\\nI made my bookings through RussianTrains.com which was easy and straightforward. I received an email re a delay in issuing tickets and after checking the website found the train we booked was unavailable. After contacting Customer Service they advised to book the train listed to ensure my I reached my destination as they didn\\'t know whether the original train would be rescheduled. There was a price difference and after becoming aware of this I again contacted Customer Service and was immediately refunded the difference. Customer Service is outstanding and always contacted me within 24 hours of a query. Would certainly recommend booking through their website.\\nGood experience overall with my first order, but the competitive price entry (5% off) vs free shipping options (add items that allow a credit for shipping) is a little confusing at first. Comparable prices to competition, but at least for the products I bought, (Optimum Nutrition - various natural protein powders), they seem to have decent prices on all items as opposed to some sites which have 1 or 2 items low priced (loss leaders), and then the rest at high prices. I can\\'t review the order fulfillment and delivery portion of their service, because I just placed the order.\\nVery helpful and welcoming\\nEasy navigation and great communication,\\nThe staff over at suppz did a great job ensuring that I got what I needed in a timely fashion.\\nI love TCB! Excellent rewards program for sure.\\nThank you for the opportunity to better my credit\\nResponse was great and service was excellent:Highly recommend this company\\nI usually can always find what I am looking for at Thrift Books.  They ship quick and deliver when they say they will.\\nFantastic product, price, device, & communications. I could not have more pleased about my purchase.\\nItem was shipped quickly and exactly as pictured.\\nI thought the price was too good to be true . Upon placing order price was exactly what was mentioned with no shipping or tax. I thought maybe the item would be a knock off. When received I was truly surprised . It was a true otter box cover. Shipping took about a week which was great. I am truly pleased and satisfied with my purchase. Will definitely continue to shop with A4C and I highly recommend everyone to shop  AND buy from them. Thank for great pricing and quality merchandise 😀\\nMy experience was ok. But I will never order from walter drake again. My reason is I never received my full order after paying for it. Also never heard back from no one about my missing items after  I wrote them several times.about it.\\nWould like to have sample pricing on PL LED lamp considering future order of 350+ and contractor wholesale pricing on an order of that size.\\nLove my lights.\\nOverall I really like asgi and have purchased from them several times. I am not a fan that you cannot apply coupon codes until right before you pay but otherwise asgi is one of the best airsoft sites.\\nGOOD PRICES, EASY TO BOOK\\nExcellent website...very user friendly.

Smooth purchase.\\nthe item was great. the shipping time was fast and i would order again and tell others to look into being a customer\\nGreat pricing on sale items, fast free shipping!\\nEasy to deal with. Couple of pictures. Couple of measurements and my cabinet hinge was identified.  Quick replies. Easy peasy\\nno problems good quality fast shipping\\nYou would not think that because of the affordable price that your stay would be in such a luxury suite all the way down to the little details.  All I can say is we booked within hours of us checking into the Honeymoon suite on June 7th - 11th 2015 and loved it so much we stayed one more night and switched over to the cabin titled \"just one more night\" which was just as nice.  I am about to book another trip  for the end of July 2015.   We can\\'t get enough.\\nThe switch to the new app was rough. I wasn\\'t able to log in for a month and a half and had to call to sign up for classes. The staff on site didn\\'t know how to fix it and wouldn\\'t take the obvious course of action to remedy the situation quickly—delete me from the system and re-enter all info from scratch. They were very helpful and seemed to be following orders, so it seemed to be a course of action from management. Eventually, we wiped the record and I was able to use the app properly. At the same time, my wife was still using the old app and hesitant to switch because of my problems. She eventually had to because she was going to lose her points in the old app. Although it makes sense to use this as a method to herd people into using the new app, it is strange that points could not be moved from one app to another.\\nLitlle bit surprise about rental price in Argentina \\nBut generally is ok\\nExcellent experience start to end. Easy, pleasant to order, fast delivery, quality merchandise. What more can you ask for?\\nWill absolutely use TextbookRush again in the future.\\nQuick  and easy to book.\\nOrdered the unlock friday night, it was unlock by the end of saturday night. Would recommend to anyone!\\nFinancially this was a very good choice. But you should decide how much your frustration is worth. The app or the system or a combination of both only work half the time. If you go to the theater expecting to see a certain movie at a certain time be prepared to pay for it yourself when the system isn\\'t working. Customer service is a polite joke. Technically after telling you to re-install the app they are useless.\\nDonald was great to work with and was able to get the correct info in the system regarding my vehicle when the VIN pulled up incorrect info. A call and confirming my vehicle options corrected the situation and adjusted the price accordingly.\\nHad what I was looking for and will buy again.\\nI had ordered 4 wardrobe cabinets when the cabinets arrived the the 3 point locking rod assembly was missing on all 4 of the cabinets. Now I have 4 cabinets that I can do nothing with. I tried emailing customer service about my issue and have not received any email or information back.\\nThank you for all info , I have found job at shopko, your site is wonderful.\\nThe price match plus 5% markdown option is what sold me. If i found a better price elsewhere, they would beat the price by 5%. The free/closeout portion is great for anyone who may want to sample some supplements before buying. A+++\\nI called and placed a order. I was sent the wrong size two times. My account was reviewed and my account was credited. I was pleased with this response. I will order again from This company. I will order my mail or on line only. They do have a good inventory selection.\\nGreat glasses but they said 3-5 days. I even paid for express shipping. It took almost 3 weeks to get the glasses.\\nPhillip Zinn did a great job getting my mortgage closed.\\nThanks!\\nI traded messages with your company back in December 2014 when I had a very bad experience on Christmas Day trying to park with my reservation. The lot was blocked off with cones and no one in evidence, until I walked on the lot and found someone. In return, I was offered two days of free parking in the future, which I gratefully accepted. However, when I attempted to use these free days on my next trip recently, I was unable to -- there was no response from the person I\\'d spoken to before. In addition, they were unable to find my reservation when I returned from my trip, so I had to pay full price for my time in order to free my car. Not sure why it is so complicated to get this all right?\\nLove this store. You can always find something to wear that\\'s cute and fits any size!💖\\nGreat customer service. Great value.\\nI would recommend this service to anyone. Great prices and honest.\\nGenerally clean, but needs remodel.  Tub was cracked and we could see they tried to patch it.  Furniture in the room was low quality.  Breakfast was nothing special.\\nThriftbooks is a great resource for any book in or out of print. The notification function is ideal, with email notification the minute your requested  book is located ; I have found many titles this way. That said, the quality is uneven. Each selection has the graded condition listed for your selection prior to purchase. This is very accurate on the Good and below levels, but for the higher ratings I find it a gamble. Books listed as like new which come from independent sellers are generally as advertised.  Books listed as like new that come directly from Thriftbooks warehouse are generally beat up. If you don\\'t care about appearances, them it\\'s no worry. But I have been burned many times purchasing a book that I intended to gift, only to receive it and realize the \"like new\" book was often scratched and bent and in no condition to give as a gift.\\nThe representative made my experience very personal and was very professional when it came to my first time buying gold.  I look forward to working with her in the near future, as I plan to purchase more gold and silver to enhance my retirement portfolio.\\nThe class was interesting, upbeat, and informative.\\nStrawberry Net makes it so easy to purchase from.\\nI got my phone unlocked in a half of a day !\\nPS 1 is like very old school. We are talking about almost 17 years. This was my first system as a kid. And all the games that I used to play are priceless. I never had any toys but video games are those that I still have in my mind. Playing old psone games again brings back those childhood memories of eating junk food and just relaxing after school on the couch.\\nVery satisfied with my order.\\nGreat customer service, prices are great also.\\nIt was a delightful experience working with cruise.com, especially the agent I worked with.Her name is Kelly at ext. 323. She returns my calls right away and answers questions we have.\\nMerlin R was awesome! So helpful and sorted out my issue within a couple of minutes!\\nThanks again!\\nWhen comparing to other options this method was pain free, less expensive and the device allowed for a larger area to be treated. My skin is getting tighter, I\\'m losing inches with every visit and getting tons of compliments from friends & family that are noticing the changes #win\\nAfter five years it was time for me to replace the carbon media in my PC-600.  I called Customer Service for assistance.  They were friendly and informative, however, that did not prevent me from having an unfavorable experience.  First, it costs over $200 for the carbon replacement kit, which is basically a sack of coconut shell carbon plus about $10 worth of plastic parts.  The replacement job is tricky, but it is expected to be a DIY.  I did try calling two of the plumbers on the recommended list supplied by Pelican, including the company that installed the system, but neither returned my call.  Pelican did supply a YouTube link which clearly explains the procedure, so I endeavored to do the job myself.  Every step of the way I watched the video, and reviewed the written instructions and it went flawlessly up to the point where I emptied and discarded the old media, poured in new media, and left it soaking for 48 hours.  The covering for my tube was made of plastic and it disintegrated when I removed it.  I reported this to Customer Service and they informed me that Pelican discontinued using plastic, my five year old system did not guarantee replacement, and I would have to purchase as stainless steel cover from them for $143.  So the 48-hour soaking period was extended several days while I waited for the new tube covering.  When the covering came, it did not fit over my tube.  Customer Service was pleasant and agreed to send me a new tube for no extra cost.  I had to wait another week for it to arrive.  Then I had to empty the soaked media from the old tube, remove the down tube and place it in the new tank, and carefully pour in the soaked media into the new tank.  Now I am in the 72-hour period of not using high flow appliances, such as laundry and dish washer, and my water will be charcoal tinted for about 10 days.  This part is normal for everybody.  You replace the old carbon and soak the new for 48 hours.  For the next 72 hours, you have to bypass the system when you use laundry of dishwasher.  For me it took much longer.  I have spent $350 and engaged in a month long process, just to complete the media replacement that needs to be done every five years.\\nUsually use a competitor\\'s website, but this was just as easy and I was able to find better deals.\\nBest price/quick and easy\\npicked up the car from nice airport on the 27th dec from a very poorly lite garage. the light was so bad the girl had a torch for us to inspect the car.\\nwe had to point out several markes on the car to her, all she kept saying was that will be ok don\\'t worry. basically she couldn\\'t care less. NOW on our return to a garage with flood lights and a girl who is going over it with a fine touth comb even on her knees under the car surprise she finds a mark under the car. this was not done by us  this is a scam by the company to fleece motorists off their money. they deducted 1100 euros from my card . and when the repair cost is taken from it they will reimburse the rest. luckeIy i purchased extra insurance in the uk .DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY\\nBeautiful pearls, lots of choices, rapid delivery, excellent quality and presentation.

Everything was very well\\nJust found out that a trip booked through them (college kid home for spring break for a week) which I was charged $464.00 would have cost me $311 if I had booked directly through American Airlines.  I did all the work, then I had to ask for the itinerary after the 24 hour period.  There was a problem they created when booking the flight so I had to speak with American Airlines in order to get on their website to choose seats and enter frequent flyer info (how I came across the actual price of the tickets). How can they justify that mark-up.  Will never use this site again and will make sure people know what a rip off it is.\\nI have been with ClearCare for a while and am very happy with my decision to leave my previous scheduling platform. What prompted the move was a lack of communication from my previous vendor. What made me choose ClearCare over the other platforms I was exploring was the fact that the system allows for my staff to be more self-sufficient, thus taking strain off my office. Before ClearCare, we were using multiple platforms for various purposes- one for scheduling, another for telephony, a website for charting visit notes, etc. The move to ClearCare has drastically cut down a lot of my time spent on administrative tasks. CC is also very responsive regarding inquiries and action items, and I love how they seek customer feedback on future planning and innovation.\\nWell it didn\\'t inform me of anything I wasn\\'t aware of !

Worth it.\\nA week after I placed my first order with doggiefood, I called the company to follow-up on its status because it still was listed as \"processing.\" I was told they were out of the items I ordered.  But, they just got one the items in and would ship it the next day with an arrival day in four business days. I was told the other item should be in stock in a couple of days. Eight business days later I emailed the company to cancel my order because I had not received either product. Their reply was that the 1st product had shipped and would be here that Thursday. However, the other item was on back order and they would gladly refund me for it. Four hours later I received this email \"I had just went to have the orijen refunded and then was informed that they did in fact have the orijen sent out to you. I am very sorry for the confusion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe eventual did receive the two items we purchased. However, the kibble was wrong. We ordered a 5lb. bag, but received 7 12oz small bags instead - not very convenient, but we were happy to have finally received our order. \\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral days later, I received a phone call from the company stating, \"as YOU know YOU received a double shipment of your order. We can send FedEx out to pick it up or we can charge your card if you want to keep it.\"  We did not receive a double order; and did not even receive our original order correctly. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many dog food companies out there. If you are looking for good customer service I would not choose doggiefood.\\nAfter about a month I can say the call quality is excellent, both domestic & international. International rates are very competitive, the main reason I chose Phonepower\\n\\nTheir web interface could use some improvements. (1) A faster server. I\\'m spoiled, I like fast servers rather than Phonepowers that takes 15 seconds to respond. (2) Custom Caller ID would be nice - the ability to assign a caller ID to numbers who call me. (3) The ability to block callers by caller ID would be nice rather than block only a phone number as currently available. Telemarketers can & do call from different numbers but they frequently show the same CID. Enough.\\nIN ORDER TO GET THE SEX DRIVE BACK WE BUY TOY AND BOTH OF US HAVE EXPERIENCE THE BEST ORGANSM EVER IN TEN YEARS\\nWhy we can\\'t cancel the booking\\nWas lied to about the help I would receive from the sales person.

The site is easy to use.\\nThailand is a wonder to travel in, and Enchanting Travels helped us develop an itinerary that suited our needs.  We loved the National Parks, waterfalls, biking, kayaking, beautiful wats (temples), learning about the culture and Buddist religion through our guide, seeing the unique countryside, riding elephants bareback and learning about them, and seeing some of Southeast Asia through local eyes.  The Mong hill tribe, agricultural farming, motor scooter traffic, monks wandering, and the Lantern Festival were just some enchanting sights around Chiang Mai.  The floating market in Bangkok was another very unique experience.  We felt we learned the most we could have possibly could have about Thai culture during our two weeks, thanks to our wonderful guide, driver and itinerary.\\nIt was a very nice experience\\nMichael Miller and Erin Scianimanico were excellent people to work with.

I bought two Littmann classic III stethoscopes, one for my wife and one for myself. One was the black tubing with black bell and the other was the raspberry tubing with rainbow bell.

I can hear so much better and pick up subtle changes that I couldn\\'t hear in my old off brand stethoscope. Medisave kept me updated every step of the way from order placement ti shipping. I feel the price of the stethoscopes, the engraving, and the shipping were very competitive.  Everything went as expected. I do like how the took the extra step to require signature for USPS to deliver at my house, but I wish it was more clear up front that a signature was required. I have a delivery lock box on my porch but USPS didn\\'t leave it and I had to go down and pick it up. Otherwise it was a great experience.

The crew explained to me it was probably from pot holes. I haven\\'t had\\r\\nthe car for to long so maybe it was from previous owner.

Stacy came in and went right to work.She glided from wine table to the dining tables, and then to buffet serving area with ease.She tidy up everything before she lift, so there was very little for me to do.\\n    This party turned out so good, that for the first time I could sit down and enjoy my guests. I will definitely use them again, and recommend them to all my friends.\\nThese guys are awesome!\\ngoooooood job\\nI am using this site from 2002 and it is very good forum for sharing knowledge.\\nI used PayPal to pay for the item purchased, and couldn\\'t get my \"One Man Company\" name changed, so the item arrived at our very small Post Office assigned to no one they knew.  I spent several days trying to figure out if it was here and how it was addressed.  Both the Sales and Customer Service folks were very helpful with the information necessary to finally get my hands on my item.  Even though I did get great help, it could have been better if we could have got the Name and address right, as opposed to the PayPal info.\\nI ordered 2 t-shirts and a game. They arrived within a week! Both shirts were sized normally so they will fit and look the same as on the site. Items didn\\'t look \"cheep or flimsy made\" I\\'m extremely pleased and would definitely order from your site again!\\nHaving placed my order on 30th november, my bank account was debited on 1st December. I received an e-mail saying my order was \\'being processed\\' soon after but no further communication was forthcoming .\\r\\nAs I needed my order to arrive so that I could post it in time for Christmas, I began contacting them to ask about the process of my order. I received no helpful communication until 14th December when I was informed that they had \\'stock issues\\' and I could cancel my order if I wished. I cancelled immediately and found an alternative supplier at extra cost to me. Next day Golfstore e-mailed me to say my order was on its way to me!!! This just should NOT have happened and I would be really reluctant to use them again! Still awaiting a refund-out of pocket and really disgruntled.\\nI love using this service,you can find some really good deals to be had\\nI ordered some custom journals to be given out during an awards ceremony. My order was supposed to arrive three weeks before the ceremony. A week after the expected arrival date, I logged in to CafePress to see why they hadn\\'t come, and my order showed as cancelled. I didn\\'t get any kind of notification from CafePress that my order had been cancelled.\\n\\nI called CafePress customer service to find out what was up, and I was told the the order had been cancelled because of a suspected copyright violation. I used our organization\\'s logo on the journals, so fair enough, I don\\'t blame them for flagging it. But to not notify me was totally unacceptable.\\n\\nThe customer service representative I spoke to was very pleasant, but she could not do anything to reinstate my order. She said she would put in a ticket to some other group that could and told me they would call me within 24 hours. 24 hours later, no call, so I called back. Spoke to the exact same very nice CSR, who gave me a phone number for this mysterious other group. Called the number, it went straight to voicemail. Left a message with my phone and email. Next day, still no call back. Called again, straight to voicemail again, left another message. No response. \\n\\nSo, totally fed up, I went and ordered the exact same type of journal from Vistaprint, which turned out to be a lot cheaper, even with the expedited shipping I had to pay for in order to get the journals before the ceremony. \\n\\nI will never use CafePress again.\\nThe experience was good. I wasn\\'t left with any worry of if I would receive my book on time.\\nOnce you set up your account, its easy to describe your project and get connected to experienced pros in your area very quickly.\\n\\nI hope the service can sign on more project pros, to keep prices competitive and costs down.\\nOrdered twice here now and both times the delivery was within 1 hour. So trustworthy! I\\'ll recommend them for sure!\\nI\\'ve ordered from numerous motorcycle sites. All of which didn\\'t deliver the products in a timely fashion as advertised. My first order from Sportbike Trackgear was delivered on time. Their prices are the best around. They also sell all the top brands around.

Will definitely be using again.\\nUpdates were easy and fast!\\ncar and service excellent.  Additional insurance very expensive\\nFast and reliable\\nWe absolutely love Hello Fresh.

I am so happy with my experience. Your site was easy to work with, your customer service people answered all of my questions. The plaque we ordered shipped out quickly. My account director was happy with the final result. We will use you again!\\nI ordered 6 Tee-shirts for Christmas. 5 of 6 were awesome. Only complaint is the 6th one had black text on a black shirt. It was almost impossible to read the text. They were not given an opportunity to fix the problem though. Since I was short on time I did not even report the problem to them.\\nUsing the web site was very easy and simple.  Reservation was quick and easy, and very convenient for scheduling parking.\\nIf I can give zero stars I will do it. Horrible company. I bought 16 bottles of green tea pills from Pharmapacks, they made me feel sick. I called past the 30 days allowed for return  and explained it on 30 May 2017 to their customer service (saying it is ok to return past 30 days because they are no good) he said yes. I paid $8.85 to ship via priority mail to them (box included 12 bottles of green tea pills that won\\'t expire in couple of years). I asked him to put a note on my order about the call he said I will. The return arrived 2nd June. I called 14 June 17 after they calling every few days to see what happened to my refund and they said we are not going to refund it is a voluntary return and this is past the 30 days allowed for return. These people are sick just like the pill they send. STAY AWAY.\\nThere are so many horror stories about travelling with Ryanair, but my experience last week was an excellent one.  Check-in was fine, the flight was great with vg service, pick up at other end all straightforward.  Both outward and return flights were on time.  Staff very pleasant at all points.  What\\'s not to like?!\\nA quick and joyful experience. Great customer service from Courtney.\\nPart came on time and was the correct part, price was good. Except for shipping which was 10 dollars.\\nI purchased a Monteverde Tool Ballpoint - Midnight Black and thought the price was $ 30.00 but the unit I received was a Model 60 at $ 39.00.  I was not aware of any difference and thought I had been overcharged.  The pricing and differences in units should be made clearer.  Other wise I have ordered perhaps 10 or 12 units plus refills and have been a happy camper up to the last purchase.\\nShipping and pricing are excellent. Customer service by phone for me was poor.\\nThe only issues I have is when buying from 3rd party. I go through the process of buying a book. Pay for it and all that. Then I get a notification that the order has been cancelled. That\\'s a little aggravating. One time I believe I ordered a book from Textbook Rush, the book was a Instructors Edition or International, I can\\'t remember. The book was taped up to hide it. I returned the book for a refund with no issues, but it was a inconvenience. Other than that I think I\\'m pretty pleased with my experience with Textbook Rush.\\nExcellent.  No problems having and handling my order. Even getting it quicker than I expected.\\nHave gotten many companies from this site and all have worked out well.\\nIt is a lot of fun and a lot of hard work!\\nVERY PRACTICAL , SAFE AND RELIABLE . THE NEXT TRIP FOR SURE WILL USE AGAIN .\\nI made the reservation online which was a super simple process, then within 12 hours the company called me and gave me more specific info and were able to answer all my questions. \\nCould not have been a better experience \\nHighly recommend\\ngot it on time.\\nI\\'ve tried other companies, WU by far is the best.

The service provided is easy to use and there is no hassle when having to return the texts. I definitely recommend this company!\\nJust What I Wanted\\nWell the place that installed wasn\\'t to helpful to me, the unit that was put in my car doesn\\'t beep when it time to blow into the unit, I have to keep taking my eyes off the road to keep checking to see if the blow sign is lite, there was a few times when I almost had and accident by looking down to see if it\\'s time to blow into the unit, I texted the company about this problem but haven\\'t heard from them, other that that I have nothing else to say about intoxalock until they fix this problem,  I will keep on trying to get in contact with them.\\nThe title says it all.....\\nvery helpful and easy\\nLike any moving company, you\\'ll have some glitches - but the guys that came out did a nice job.\\nDelivery on Time and great flowers.\\nEasy to use.

Unfortunately it was on sale and so I can\\'t return it.\\nI am very pleased with the service and more than pleased with the  product.\\nQuality products,prompt shipping and excellent pricing\\nWe were extremely disappointed with our bouqs subscription.  our first delivery of flowers was a nice bouquet of roses. From there on out, the rest were lackluster and subpar. For the amount of money you are paying for these bouquets, you can go to your local grocery store and get something four times as nice. They are overpriced and inconsistent. I would not order from them again.\\nI\\'ve order 3 different pairs so far and had to return 2 of the 3 due to sizing (one pair they sent me one boot size 7 and one a size 9???) but returns were simple enough just the inconvenience of waiting to get the new pair. Overall I like all pairs I\\'ve received and will likely order again.\\nFinally bought this game and then I can\\'t play it because of a manual authorization so now have to wait for bundle stars to fix it\\nMy husband was very happy with the shirt\\nProduct was as described and it arrived fast. I couldn\\'t be happier.\\nExcellent service, comprehensive feedback and a resume that has delivered excellent results from potential employers\\nA+++\\r\\nFree shipping and product arrived as advertised.\\nTrust & Will makes creating a will so easy and affordable. I always knew I needed one but avoided it through traditional methods because it seemed so difficult and expensive and didn’t know if any simple solutions. With Trust & Will, the process was super easy, quick to complete, and the finished product is perfect. I know that an update in the future will be the same now too! Thanks for this modern solution!\\nKohls is awful. They have the worst service ever... and I spend a good amount of money there because their cloths fit me well. Guess I need a new place. Don\\'t shop at kohls.com, they are liars and cheaters! Their culture must be toxic if all the employees are that useless to the customers.\\nI have really enjoyed receiving my Hello Fresh deliveries - other than delays due to ridiculous amounts of snow - which are unavoidable, service has been excellent.

BUT THE AIRLINE THAT YOU BOOK GETS ONLY A ONE STAR.I SAY THIS BECAUSE THE AIRLINE THAT I WAS BOOKED ON DOES NOT GIVE YOU A OPPORTUNITY TO PICK YOUR SEATS. THE NON-STOP FLT. 6209 TO GATWICK AND 6211 WILL HAVE THE SAME OPTION, THE SEATS WILL NOT OPEN UNTIL ONE OR TWO DAYS BEFORE THE FLIGHT. THAT IS WHAT I WAS TOLD BY 1800FLYEUROPE NOW.

Mansion casino ask for ID before  me, the customer gambles.....\\nI bought 2 electronic giftcards recently, during the same purchase.  The delivery email was received that same afternoon, which was GREAT!  I used one of the giftcards immediately for an online order, and it worked fine.  The other one, I printed to take with me to a restaurant that evening.  However, when paying for my dinner, the card didn\\'t work, which was extremely embarrassing!  I will know next time to check the restaurant site to make sure that the card is showing an active balance.  I reported this to Cardpool the next day, and my money was refunded within a few days.\\nI purchased 6 e-giftcards for Bed Bath & Beyond. They were for varying amounts, but the listings were otherwise identical. Three of them worked on the BB&B website, the other three would produce errors. After several emails and phone calls to GiftCards.com, BB&B, and Google (since they are a \"Google trusted site\"), I found out that the ones that were causing errors were merchandise credits, which cannot be used on BB&B\\'s website. The listing did not indicate this, and I would not have purchased them otherwise, as it is not convenient for me to go to BB&B store. GiftCards.com was unresponsive to my emails, rude to me on the phone, and the issue was not resolved to my satisfaction. Will never use again; not worth it for a 5-10% discount.\\nWe have always had excellent service on the floor and by the delivery staff.  That is why we keep returning. We have purchased many pieces of furniture, flooring, and major appliances for three houses over the years they have been located in Kansas City.

All of the items that I ordered arrived on time perfectly.\\nenjoy the service. thanks for your efforts.\\nI used Craft Cuts recently for a sorority project I needed to complete. I made sure to have the order submitted ahead of time so I would have time to create the project. However, when the package arrived it was not my order. The inside label clearly had a different address and order. Although Craft Cuts resolved this, they did not exopodite remaking my order or express mail it to me. I wish Craft Cuts had taken it upon themselves to get the order to me sooner since it was completely their fault. \\nI was happy with the actual materials of my order which is why I am giving them 3 stars.\\nI ordered the 1\" Powder Blue Luster Zircon Fire Glass. I got the product in good time, it was packaged well with 2 pieces broken, the rest in good shape. The shape and color were as described and looked like the picture but I was not expecting the irridescent shine on all of the pieces. The picture showed a clear blue with none of that rainbow looking shine. Customer service was prompt to return my email with a phone call and explained that the \"luster\" in the description is the shine I\\'m seeing. It\\'s pretty, just not what I thought I was buying.\\nQuality company!\\nVery good service\\nI want to thank the company very much for the prompt delivery got my package a day ahead of schedule.

However i have since been charged a further £28 taxes.  I appreciate Taxes need to be paid, but DONT say they are included if you then intent to deceive the customer and not include them.  This is very disapointing.  I contacted custoemr support, who \\n said that the \"shipping and Taxes\" ESTIMATOR is only an estimate and that actually it does not inlcude taxes anyway.  On being told thsi is suggested they change the web page to a more honest description but was told that this would loose them sales as it would make them too expensive so they would therefore not be doing that.  \\n\\nAs a busines they have lied and deceived me as a customer, they have quoted something that is \"included\" and have not followed through with your written contract.

And the staff is compassionate and efficient.\\nPlease contact me because I changed my email address on your website and I can no longer login\\nWhen leaving my car and upon pick-up, everything was flawless.  No waiting for the shuttle to get me to the airport.  When returning from the airport, the shuttle was there within minutes.

Could have not had any better service than that.\\nOrdered air filter and cabin air filter for Mazda CX5, prices were lowest I could find on the internet and filters were perfect.\\nDriver and attendant were very professional, courteous and reliable.\\nand this was in the middle of night both ways.

I made an expensive purchase for Valentine\\'s online and was horribly disappointed.  My order arrived and fell apart right out of the box.  I was devastated.  Luckily, we were able to return it and exchange it at our local store.  I don\\'t think I will risk ordering anything else from Reed\\'s online.  I\\'ll just stick with purchasing in store.\\nI purchased a three year drop, damage, break policy for my son\\'s computer.\\nI had to continue to call square trade to have the computer repaired.\\nThe 1st time (45 minute call) they didn\\'t have any record of my policy and was told to call back in 48 hours.  The 2nd time (a 50 minute call)  they blamed Costco for not having the policy.   Costco took over and called square trade to fix the problem. The 3rd time (a 45 minute call) they found the policy and proceeded to submit the claim of the on/off button not working.   Even though I have a coverall for damages to the laptop, they continued to ask me if there was damage or had it been dropped.   I am still waiting to get the laptop back.  If there is another option to square trade, I would try it.\\nI don\\'t understand why I pay for a set up fee every time I order something, even a repeat item, when you have \"set up\" several different items, other than to just generate income.

Only booking directly with the airline.\\nFacility was clean, offered great specials, and provided friendly and knowledgeable staff. My over all renting process was quick and pleasant.\\nHello. I found your site purely by accident. I was actually looking for a watch for someone else and next thing I knew I started seeing watches I was interested in. What a vast selection of men\\'s watches . I\\'ll be back. Thanks\\nWonderful\\nI love it\\nHotel Marina El Cid was 5-star all the way...restaurants, service, beach, convenience, cleanliness, terrific room and facilities.  There was a problem with the Vacation Express (Nexxus?) person who was not where he or she was supposed to be (for hours) to let us know when the shuttle would be picking us up, and we spent a fair amount of time trying to find this simple but essential bit of information.  We would have preferred to be spending our last day on the beach, relaxing, instead of pursuing someone who did not show up for work.  The hotel itself was extraordinary.  This was our 7th Mexico (Cancun or Riviera Maya) trip with Vacation Express and one of the best places to stay.  We have nothing but praise for the hotel.\\nGood going so far\\nPrompt mail service, cheaper than competitors, and easy!\\nI chose a level 100-110 level boost and then contact me a week after I made the purchase. They said it is bank problem but I don\\'t actually know. I got to 110 myself by the time they contact me. So they helped me to switch my order to +15 key boost. I chose lower karazhan for mythic score. The run is fine, I went on there as healer rather than dd so they look for a dd in grp finder. Tank did make some mistakes. The Mage gave good dps but not all of them. (At least from my point of view. I\\'m a 935 H priest with 1900+ Mythic score). Team would be a better boost grp with cr. (at least for my point). The dungeon with this week affix is quite tricky. Not very happy coz we didn\\'t finish in time. There can be more improvement. To me it doesn\\'t worth the amount of money I spent but it differ from ppl. So choose wisely.\\nThe site was fast and easy to use.

He worked very hard to help us obtain the right product for our business.  He always kept us updated on the status of the process and explained everything in a professional and understandable manner.  As a repeat customer, we highly recommend Rapid Advance!\\nTheir site is clean and easy to navigate. It\\'s a mother and daughter owned store, so you don\\'t get that creepy vibe like a lot of other sex toy sites. My order arrived in discreet packaging, nicely wrapped, and they even included a free lube sample in my order. Oh, and they take paypal, too (I only buy online with paypal).\\nThe only reason it is not a 5 star is because it has not yet funded.

The premises were very clean and I feel safe storing my storage here.\\nThe staff was also five star!!  This is a wonderful destination for those who value not only the latest in tech i.e. window coverings, studios facing north, real desert plants maintained outside each and every residence,  floor plans that bring the outside in, not to mention, once again, five star amenities in bath, kitchen and laundry.  The ease of passing your trash from your floor location, to full mail service, to secure covered garage space, to extra storage available is so well thought out by developer.  Now I did not even get into topside pool plus amenities, nor fitness to any degree, whether it be your own personal trainer or yoga inside or outside on the grass.  Now the only thing left is food.  You can walk to a grand food lovers dream of everything from Mastros Ocean Club  to N.Italiano to Sheck Shack hot dogs r us, to the very special atmosphere extraordinaire Eddie Vs.  How could you not love this most beautiful place on earth.  My gift is an easy smile, and I am smiling all day long.\\nBeautiful watch\\nThey had a great selection of campers to choose from.

I would use them again.\\nThey had everything I needed at a great price.\\nFirst time ordering, found the website easy to use and navigate.  I chose my base template, made some minor edits, and quickly uploaded my company logo.  Placed my order (saved about 5% over other sites I looked at), and had confirmation emails within a couple minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cards arrived in a matter of days, carefully packaged as to not get damaged in transit.  The print of the return address on the envelopes was well done, clean, and perfectly centered.  The print on the cards themselves was also immaculate.  The most impressive part was the weight of the card stock used.  Nice, thick paper that has proven to be a good solid card (shouldn\\'t get mangled in the mail).\\r\\n\\r\\n100% getting my business next year.\\nGood product and fast speed service (I had a deefective cartridge replacement with no questions asked in few days)\\nThe plants were way smaller that they were described and the pictures shown.  When I talked to someone there they told me plants would be in great shape and big.\\r\\nThe gardenia is dying and leaves it is not even the plant I talked about with the phone person.  The Tea Olive is way smaller that I was told,  It will take 20 years if it is a slow like described to get 5 feet tall.  I am very disappointed in your company and do not plan to shop here again.\\nI would like to thank to Endoca! Its is a very nice team, which is always ready to help you with advices and information. Quality of their products is also super! Delivery always on time! Good job, guys :)\\nI only operate a small 10hp outboard on a little lake on which I\\'ve been boating for about 60 years.  I do this for about 2 weeks a year.  There are no buoys, no channels, no markers, no ocean going freighters.  In fact, there are hardly any boats.  I know the lake like the proverbial back of my hand.  To pay 50 dollars and to have to learn all this information, yikes.\\n\\nA more appropriate test would have been nice\\nThe shipping charges to Canada was very reasonable considering it was to my door with no additional charges. Also the shipping time was extremely fast.\\nI\\'ve been buying supplements from pureformulas.com for years and I\\'ve never had any issues.\\nPlaced a large order online bathing suit bottoms were missing!! Forced to order another and pay!!!  Then will be refunded when I return the top.  This is unbelievable!!! KOHLS YOU SCREWED UP NOT ME!\\nThe Frames Direct price was much better than the prices of all other companies.

Overall, I am extremely satisfied.\\nGood site but not clear enough on pricing\\nThe service was excellent (in Spanish and English) and faster according the time expected. They help me, step by step in the application. Great service!\\nAlex was excellent in helping us out , thanks\\nSecond bed of this type that we\\'ve ordered.  Hoped for earlier delivery!!!  Our house flooded.  Wanted to be back in our master bedroom just after the walls and floors were finished.  NFM delivery options were 2 weeks out.  However, it\\'s nice to have it delivered!\\nI ordered a houndstooth scarf and after inspection, I realized there was a hole.  I called Scarves.com and was pleased with the customer service.  They apologized and promised to send out a replacement scarf that same day free of charge.  However, when the postman rang my doorbell, he told me that Scarves.com paid for one pound of postage, but that my scarf was over a pound and that I needed to pay $1 before he would give me my scarf.  Interesting!....\\nI had a great experience dealing with Flashbay. I went with the natural wood usb product and it fits my business perfectly.

They have terrible identity security, and their customer service representatives are incompetent. I was on the line for an hour, and after talking to two separate CSR\\'s, with the supervisor Valerie being the most incompetent, they finally put me through to the loss prevention department where I was presented with an answering machine. Keep in mind that the first words out of my mouth when I called them was \"Can I speak to the loss prevention department please\". I strongly recommend no one ever do business with this company.\\nI have never found a better host than Hyper Expert. I\\'ve went through so many hosts throughout the years at least 20. Thank you for this host existing.\\nSCAM SCAM SCAM SCAM SCAM SCAM SCAM SCAM SCAM ...\\n\\n\\nSo basically I bought a super mario odyssey because they offered a promotion with amazon pay ( I usually pay with paypal I should have do the same here), I paid with it. but they sent me a splatoon 2 code. ( I already bought splatoon 2 this july from the same website) ,  I asked for a refund since they made a mistake BUT they refused and they stopped answering to my emails without any explanation.\\nOne month after, I met a real life friend, I decided to sell him splatoon 2,we tried together the code they sent me but guess what ? IT WAS USED. I was very angry,my friend was very angry too, I contacted them,they told me they would fix my situation the day after tomorrow HOWEVER ,they didn\\'t replied to my emails the whole day,facebook page replied that they can\\'t refund ,they are sourced from nintendo and there is nothing they can do about it. \\n\\nSo basically I buy product from their website,it\\'s defective,and instead of being sorry and ashamed,they keep inventing excuses to don\\'t give money back , and they tell you to contact the publisher I was like WHAT THE F***then they blocked me from facebook,they stole 55 euros from me,for giving an used code. My mistake was paying with my card, claiming a dispute will be more complicated, but I will definitely do it and I\\'m planning to sue them on the postal police. They stole my money and their attitude is just unacceptable because they are total helpless and lazy. \\n\\nI will try everything to win my money back but it\\'s hard,since those people don\\'t even have a live chat to talk to them and to their emails they don\\'t even answer.  \\n\\nAVOID THIS WEBSITE LIKE A PLAGUE,THEY ARE SCAMMERS,AND ALSO THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY AWFUL.    Thumbs down.\\nFantastic hotel used through Gala Hotels and easy to book. Only issue was it wasn\\'t the room I had booked online. I had rung Gala Hotels head office specifically to double check that upon our arrival we had a twin double but when we arrived at the hotel it was a double bed not a twin. Bit disappointing however The Hotel were fantastic and soon sorted it so wasn\\'t a problem. I even sprained my ankle while staying in Dublin and the hotel at no extra charge up graded myself and my mum to a junior suite with a walk in wet room and left complimentary vouchers for the bar, chocolate and even gave us a free pizza! Fantastic service, would definitely go back.\\nLooking forward to use the apt!!!\\nI ordered two items, and received an email two days later that my items have shipped. I opened the email only to find that the one item was cancelled because it was out of stock. I went onto their website and saw that the item said it was in stock, so I called to see whether they would be able to fulfill my order. After being on hold for quite some time a woman answered and rudely told me she needed my credit card number to order the item that was in fact in stock. After I got off of the phone with the woman, I added up the two separate amounts I paid and realized I was paying more than I was initially. After calling back and waiting again, the woman put me on hold to check why the prices were different. She then preceded to tell me that it was their mistake and that I should have paid more initially, but that it was their problem. However, she said that the new total was correct. I told her that I did not think it was fair that I pay more when it was their mistake, but she could care less. I said that I was very unhappy and that it was not right of them to do and that I wouldn\\'t be ordering from them again, and she responded with \"Go talk.\" Never have I ever dealt with such horrible customer service. Don\\'t order from this company, nobody should be treated so disrespectfully.\\nApplied for credit online, worked great and is being delivered 3 hours away in 3 days, can\\'t beat it.\\nThe in-store experience was very nice and l will shop the store again l am sure. I am a little dissatisfied with the delivery team though, it seems the delivery guys were in such a rush that they forgot to completely put together my purchase...otherwise l am satisfied and look forward to this little error being corrected.\\nADT sales consultant, Ken Wall is very knowledgeable about his job and the security products that he presented. He explained everything  thoroughly with me and was not pushy, but made appropriate security suggestions for my safety based on the layout of my home.\\nthank you pretty fast process\\nGreat tickets at a fair price, without having to fight with bots or resellers.\\nI learned about strings by mail on a forum and decided to give it a shot.

They have it all (most of the time), prices are good and I\\'ve had great experiences with their customer service. This company has been around a long time and their drive to improve their on all fronts is noticeable and appreciated.\\nReceived the pens yesterday. They are very nice! Typically one thinks of a promotional pen as being a cheap piece of plastic but these are substantial, have a soft grip feel and write very smoothly. I am kind of a pen snob that way. I love the added feature of the device stylus. I expect that my customers would want to refill over and over instead of throwing away (it\\'s too nice) and this will double or triple my advertising exposure. \\nThanks so much!\\nVery clean unit and facility. Very professional as well.\\nExtremely efficient service.  I received emails and updates as my order was being processed including the UPS tracking number, so I knew where my order was at all times.  Delivery was less than 3 days.  The products are great also.\\nI loved my item! It came very quickly and it was as advertised! I\\'ll be referring this site to as many people as possible and I\\'ll be purchasing more!❤️\\nDue to Volcano I cancelled the trip to Bali for January 2018.

Impala or an American car.  Hope I can use your company again in the near future.\\nExcellent service. Fast shipment. Will purchase from again.\\nI booked with my card and there was problem with it, they took the reservation and the money, but when I went to the office in Dubai to get the car, my card was not acceptable anymore, for it was a debit card and not credit card.\\r\\nThey did not accept any other payment means and told us we will get a refund.\\r\\nToday, they informed us that we would not get any refund and that it was their policy.\\r\\nTo sum up, No car, No refund, and it is normal for them.\\r\\nI believe paying for something and and getting neither the car neither the refund, it is unacceptable.\\nI couldn\\'t believe how fast my order got to me, in Hawaii, and I even requested a font that wasn\\'t listed.\\nThey kindly allowed me to return a paddle that just wasn\\'t working for me (the handle was too large) when I misunderstood the return policy.

Always more variety and deeper discounts than steams weekly specials. Check them out!\\nI just spent three days in this wonderful house.  And I have already reserved it for ten days in January.  I lived in Sacramento for 40 years and now live out of state.  I come back to Sac to see Kids and Grandkids 4 times per year.  I wanted to try an alternative to a hotel or staying with friends.  The neighborhood is great, the yard is very cute and perfect for grandkids.  Highly recommend!\\nCan\\'t fault the service, but the car was one of those new fangled sort with keyless entry, no handbrake, no cd, an aeroplane cockpit with no instructions. Much prefer an old fashioned model.\\nInstant delivery on digital item and worked as expected.\\nearly polite and helpful, good communications\\nDo not get a free trial through this company! I ordered one in August and did. It recieve it until September 29 th.  They are very decieptful in how they do the automatic renewal. They want you to cancel by the 1st which was 2 days after I received the box. I notified them on the 2nd of October which only gave me three days to try the box. They wouldn\\'t cancel it and they charged my credit card $265. The products are ok and I would never want another box. I never write reviews but people need to know what they are getting into with this company. I actually tried to cancel back in August and the representative said that she would love me to try the product first. I guess what she meant by that was you would get a day to try the product and if you don\\'t cancel we will charge you 6 months worth of boxes. Most companies charge once a month and this is how they screw you over. You can\\'t get a hold of anyone either via phone. I reported them to my credit company and it looks like I\\'m not the first on who has done this.\\nExcellent course, learn a lot from it. The best part that we can do it in your own pace. Thank you.\\nExcellent high quality work for highly competitive prices and service is 2nd to none!\\nSuper easy process!\\nCorrect part ordered and received in a timely and affordable manner.\\nWe acquire many of our new contacts at outdoor events. The crowds are too big for digital collection (plus there\\'s no wifi) so we have to depend on written signups. When we return and transfer contacts to a spreadsheet for upload, we are getting >20% bounces. Our email provider was not happy with us. We had to find a way to clean up the list before we uploaded. After some searching we settled on ZeroBounce. I was totally impressed with the thoroughness of their review. It found that 24 contacts were invalid. Yikes. There was even a category called \"abuse\". These are abusers who just like to report email as spam. Watch out for them!!! I was able to upload my list into our email provider with not one problem. Thank you.\\nplus got free shipping and 30 percent of second toy great buys.........\\nMy number one source for all my model needs!  They have had many models in stock that the manufacturer (Revell) did not.  Shipments easy to track, always on time, and never had error or damage.  I go to Hobbylinc first for everything from models to supplies.\\n\\nThey are the only bookmark you need for all your model needs.  I highly recommend Hobbylinc for every model enthusiast.\\nI received my book in the mannor in which they told me when I would receive it.  No problems. I would defiently use textbook rush again..\\neasy and good items.\\nSunday my grill for my 60 year old floor furnace broke into a million pieces.  Having a four year old in the house having a 3\\' x 2\\' open hole in the floor of my living room wasn\\'t safe, so I needed a replacement ASAP.  I had no luck at local stores and went to google.  There I found Jedco Supply.  I made a quick call to them and talked a wonderful guy who was able to find out that they had one in the size I needed in stock and that if I ordered it that day that it would be to me in Norfollk VA within 2 days.  I talked to my husband and placed my order on Monday around 2 PM (it was so affordable to, shipping was $8!).  Sure enough today around 2 PM my new grill was waiting for me at my house.  About a 48 hour turn around which is exceptional.  The grill itself is well made and super sturdy (for all the foot traffic) and fit wonderfully.  I would definitely recommend Jedco to anyone.  :)\\nFast easy and they take care of sending a tow truck for you.  Follow you every step of the way.  Highly recommended.\\nI use ThriftBooks for all my book purchases. Great delivery time, great prices, books in great shape.

Super fast shipping and it was back to the Robot working the weekend and NOT me.\\nMy mother woke up in tears to find out that Agoda had cancelled our hotel stay and taken over £500 out of her account. The email response was the following: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease be informed that according to our terms of use we reserve the right not to accept customers or bookings (or in exceptional cases to cancel confirmed ones) at our discretion and for whatever (legal) reason without the need to justify such refusal.

Also, I got a great rate that was not available on comparable sites.  VERY pleased!!!\\nFor a recent trip to Seattle I purchased a city pass and it made a huge and positive difference in our trip. We had flight delays from the east coast which meant we had more than 24 hours less time than we\\'d planned in Seattle. Because we had prepurchased the city pass, we didn\\'t have to wait in as many lines which meant we got to see more in our limited time. It also saved us a lot of money. We so enjoyed our time at the EMP, Chihuly gardens, and harbor cruise. We definitely thought we got our money\\'s worth and more. I highly recommend this product.\\nThe website is really easy to navigate and intuitive.

I was a little nervous with the price, but on 1stop bedrooms it was almost a grand cheaper and the customer service was fabulous. I will be shopping here in the future!\\nEverything arrived in good condition and is growing nicely\\nWhile the daily rates were cheaper than most in the area, I would NOT recommend going to this location if you have anything of value left in your vehicle.  I had personal belongings in my vehicle (hidden in my center console), and they were not in my vehicle upon my return.  It says a lot about a company when their employees need to steal from their customers.  I will gladly pay full price at the airport next time to know my vehicle and it\\'s belongings are safe from theft.  The shuttle driver was very nice - that was the only positive from this whole experience.\\nWe have accidentally set the alarm off twice.  They have been very prompt in responding.  This gives me confidence in knowing that if the alarm is real, their response will be prompt.  It gives me peace of mind knowing they are looking after my home.\\nGreat website and products. Seamless transaction. Yay!\\nI ordered a customized toiletry bag and a custom t-shirt. The t-shirt is \\'in production\\' and is estimated to arrive Jan 1-7. I understand Christmas is a busy time for both production and shipping, but I placed my order Dec 21st and your telling me it\\'s going to take almost a month to produce and ship a t-shirt. I can\\'t help but think there is something wrong with this picture. Especially since the toiletry bag arrived last week.\\nI was looking around for the cheapest coin website and this is it .

Saw an article that said Dial 7 was cheaper and had online ordering. It took me about 4 seconds to make a reservation, and my car was waiting by the time I got out of row five and out the door with no luggage. Quick, easy, professional, reasonable price.\\nKillCliff is a great product.  Easy to order and have shipped to your door.  Awesome taste, natural and low calorie.\\nLove this site and great price. Thanks guys\\nVery pleased with the frames and how promptly they arrived.  They are a nice way to display and protect posters and collectibles.   Secure well to the wall and appreciate how the screw heads hide and how they will be easy to access in the future if I want to move elsewhere.\\nShort interview with good results as to my needs and budget.\\nI called several times about my order and got the same person every time! She said she was having trouble with her computer and could not help me. I paid thirty extra dollars to have my order shipped faster. What a joke! It still took several days to get the package. I will never shop DXL again! I spent over 1200 dollars for the worst service!!!\\nAlways have the most stylish frames\\nI like the user interface design.\\nSeems that item are often miss graded. \\r\\n\\r\\nSome sellers are willing to work with you and others blame you for their mistakes. \\r\\n\\r\\nDiscogs seem to take the easier route and just side with the seller opposed to working the issues out. \\r\\n\\r\\nGood when no issues arise but that seems to be few and far between.\\nEverything was smooth and easy. Only complicance was finding a printer for printing the vautcher :)\\nEasy to navigate and awesome merchandise!\\nBought Goethia. The only drawback was that it smells somewhat of  cigarette smoke, but that should dissipate with time. The order came in quickly and there were no problems.\\nIt was a great experience except that I expected faster shipping given how much I payed for shipping.\\nWhy Egypt is not Listed in Registration Page\\nI had a great experience\\nI placed a $200 order on Wednesday May 27th. I paid $30 for the fastest shipping option available. That would mean that my items would arrive around Monday June 1st (today) and Tuesday June 2nd. I checked UPS today and my items hadn\\'t even been shipped. I called UPS. Guess what they said? THEY HADN\\'T EVEN RECEIVED THE ITEMS FROM CORSET STORY YET. Corset Story had generated 2 tracking numbers for my items on Friday May 29th, and yet here we are at 6 p.m. Texas time on Monday June 1st...and my items haven\\'t even been sent to UPS yet. I have sent TWO emails to them today. The first to the Order Enquiry department at around noon-1 p.m. my time, and a second email to the Complaints department at around 3 p.m. I then private messaged them on Facebook and sent a Tweet to them on Twitter. I have not heard a single word back from them. UPS told me today that if they did not receive the packages by end of business today, they would not be able to get my items to me by Thursday June 4th (which is when I MUST have them because I\\'m going out of town that day). So, as of this moment, I am screwed out of receiving my clothing and wasted $200 on this, unless these people actually have souls and will refund me my FULL amount given this massive inconvenience. Or, if I don\\'t get my money back, I will just file a formal complaint with the business in the UK that handles fraudulent transactions and false advertisement.\\nIf you are wanting a boat licence this is the best site to take it on. Very informative and easy to understand.\\nThe part was of high quality  and it was delivered very promptly. The only complaint was that I had a hard time contacting someone by phone to place an order.\\nEverything on time!\\ngood and prompt and will be back again soon\\nvery fast and easy to use\\nI love Dial 7. Our first time in NYC and we wanted a reliable car service to take us to the airport. We checked the reviews of Dial 7 and were not disappointed. They are prompt, reliable and polite. I\\'ve used them 3 times already since my arrival and plan to use again. Cars are immaculately clean and very comfortable. I would highly recommend this car service.\\nI got hung up on. When I got thru thanks to a manager at the car place. So I could change my address. I was told my down payment would be $250.00 instead of $500.00. But when I went to sign the papers it had the down payment as 500.00.So be careful in dealing with Roadloans. They tell you one thing on the phone. When you get the loan the down payment isn\\'the what they tell you on the phone.\\nI concerned about the perishabikity of such decadent splurge.  It was received perfectly packed and on time.  OLMA reached out throughout  the process.  Thrilled with the product as well as the entire experience.\\ngreat prices and fast shipping\\nQuick easy installation. For some reason they couldnt find my order number but I had a copy on me and all is well.\\nGlad I made a choice with freedom debit. Everything good so far \\nThank you\\nI love the service offered by this company, they are just awesome!\\nVery good. What made us believe in the company was when we called to confirm our car a real person from the USA answered all the questions.  We were not shuttled from one push this button to push that button. Please do not get so big you do not personally talk to customers\\nI first tried their products on my first visit to Jerusalem and loved them. I specially like the Biox Intensive Age Defying Cream because it has made my face look younger and smother.\\nI belong to a paperback swap club but many of my favorite writers and titles are long, long waits; like up to a year or even two years to get. Ah, here\\'s where Thrift Books filled my desire and now I cut the long wait list for many of these books by ordering from Thrift Books. They ship fast and at a great cost savings. The three book order with no postage makes it even better! Fantastic inventory in about any genre you looking for. And you can even get alerts for books your looking for if they don\\'t have it presently. You can\\'t beat the price, quick service and vast inventory of titles. Thrift books made my dreams come true especially in finding \\'hard to find\\' books and authors.It\\'s my go-to site hand down! Gery B.\\nThe driver arrived ten minutes early. He was professional, knowledgeable, and an excellent driver. I was very pleased with the experience.\\nA good experience of GoDaddy from the word go! Easy to buy a domain and set up hosting for it, plus their helpful customer support is simple to access by phone and you get a PIN to type in so you don\\'t have to go through annoying security questions. Recommended for a smooth ride.\\nMy experiences have been very favorable with\\nyour services.  My only complaint is that your\\nfees have increased appreciably in the last\\nfive years.\\nCustomer care informed me they no longer carry the extension kit for my crib. They were very polite! But their service didn\\'t stop there. They looked up other websites that do carry the bedrails and found them for me! What wonderful service!\\nGreat servis. Easy to get your car\\nI trust Big Picture Loans cause i allready had one loan and it is a excelent company and trusty that will let you know everytime you make your payment. I love it and recomend it to anybody.\\nI placed an order with a competitor, and am still trying to resolve the mess they made -- no communication, wrong product shipped -- and I am delighted with the prompt, professional way my order with you guys has been handled.  I\\'ll be back when the need arises.\\nwow ia all I can say\\nAlways good service.\\nOrdered the same time as an order from Amazon.  Recieved the vitemans two weeks earlier.  I have always had great services from this company.\\nGreat communication and shipping.\\nI\\'ve travelled to almost 40 countries and took many tours but this tour was the worst experience I have ever had. It is poorly designed and executed, here\\'s the things that went wrong:\\n-Weeks before our trip to Peru, we contacted Viator to add Huayna Picchu experience to our tour, after 4 attempts and various email confirmations, we sent your request to local tour operator, etc. nothing came out of it. \\n-We weren\\'t picked up from our central Cusco hotel by bus but had to walk with our heavy bags to 3 different locations in the city before being picked up, the bus left Cusco 45 minutes lateor one hour and 10 min from the time we were met by a guide at our hotel\\n-At our first stop, Pisac market we were given 15 min ONLY to see the market which is this big, incredible place, what a waste! At the next stop, the Pisac ruins, we had to remind the guide we were suppose to get tickets for the ruins, he then lined up to buy them, we had to wait for a bit, get back on the bus, wait for the bus to park, and were given only 30 min to see the ruins, a lot of time was wasted, it took us at least 10 min to find our way back to the bus which was parked at a different spot far away from the ruins entrance. We got to spent about 15-20 minutes at the ruins, again not enough time.\\n-Next stop, Ollantaytambo, again we were given 30-40 min max 15 of which were spent listening to the guide before even venturing to the ruins, this place is huge we had to run through it, there was no time for a toilet break, but our trouble really started once we arrived to Aguas Calientes the Machu Picchu village in the evening\\n-We were told by the guide in Cusco that we will be met by a local guide and receive all the Machu Picchu details that night, however no one showed up, we did not have MP tickets nor the departure time next morning. After waiting for a couple of hours and spending time around the phone, over 4 hours later we finely found out the pick up time. Next morning the guide who picked us up, asked me to line up for the MP bus tickets and sent my friend to an office to pick up MP tickets. Once my friend got there, she was scolded by the office person who asked her where her guide was as she was not supposed to issue tickets to her but a guide only. Finally, the office person made an exception and we made it to the MP grounds entrance, we were yet again supposed to be met by another guide, it was 7:30 am and the guide didn\\'t show up until after 9 am!! We were so tired and frustrated by this point as we had very little sleep having had to spend the previous night trying to find out the tour details. When they showed up the guide asked us to join another group, the new guide was repeating the same things over and over again, he wasn\\'t very knowledgeable and was also translating everything for a sole spanish-speaking person in the group, the whole thing was quite a disappointment! Viator and their local operators run extremely bad business, I would never recommend this tour to anyone.\\nGreat Help and Fast.\\nthe room was clean, its in the zone 1 of Paris,which is really good for city explorers. the people are kind and speak english. nice stay for some days in Paris. \\nits a little bit noisy by night, you can hear the people next to you speaking, but for few days its a nice location.\\nThis was my first experience with Ship Stixs and it was fantastic.  I followed all the instructions for preparing my clubs for shipment and placed them on my porch.  They were picked up that day and were waiting for me upon my arrival to my vacation destination.  When I returned home my clubs returned on the requested date.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter shopping around for pricing, I found Ship Stixs to be the cheapest. The service was outstanding and I would definitely use them again.\\nConvenient hotel for klia airport, beds were hard and rooms off of the corridors were noisy all day and night.\\nStaff in the restaurant and cafe tended to disappear or were inattentive.\\nI love buying from PetFlow, besides the company\\'s commitment to helping others, they provide a great selection of high quality foods, treats and accessories for our animals!  We have 3 cats and a puppy, lugging bags of food to feed these guys is not my idea of fun.  It is so convenient to have my order delivered to my front door where I can pour it right into their containers on wheels with minimal lifting required!  The time it saves me to just go on line and place my order, rather than go to the pet store is priceless!  They have great prices and service, I tell everyone I know with animals about PetFlow (they have a referral program, but I would rather that money go towards the various causes they help with in disasters, etc...)\\nbought the hanadama earrings for my mom and she absolutely loved them. The earrings came in a very elegant box and a certificate of authenticity. Will definitely be buying from the pearl source again in the future, no doubt about it.\\nOutstanding products!!! I am not a huge seafood fan but I just LOVE the salmon, tuna and sardines from Vital Choice. I\\'ve never been a fan of tuna but their tuna is the best I\\'ve ever tasted. I can never stomach sardines but theirs are absolutely delicious. For my next order I\\'m going to try some mackerel - which I NEVER tasted in my life. Thank you so much Vital Choice. I can\\'t ever imagine eating anyone else\\'s seafood ever again.\\nVery unhappy with this rental start to finish. I voiced my concerns when I dropped the car off but nothing was done. I’ve exclusively rented from you guys the last several years but I will be looking to other companies for my next rental.\\nThe majority of the books I purchased were in great condition. Almost new!\\nJust like the \"old fashioned\" local hardware store that are nearly extinct - but online.  I ordered a couple of hinges online one afternoon.  Got a call the next morning to tell me that the item is not in stock and it will be several weeks before it\\'s re-stocked.  I was working with a deadline.  He suggested that I try a larger size that they had but it would not work with the door I had.  He then suggested that I use another brand (well known name) that they had in stock with the finish and size I needed.  I recognized the name and thought it would be more expensive (it was) but was told that because it was their mistake in their inventory system that they would give it to me at the same price as the original but not in stock - hinges.  Because of the deadline I had I was worried about the timing as I had already lost a day.  I was shocked when I received it via Fedex within a few days.  \\'m sure they lost money on this sale.  In exchange they now have a new loyal customer.\\nI shopped around quite a bit to replace a sofa, chair and ottoman and had never bought online before, only from a local retailer. I knew what I wanted and had a limited budget, but from the very first contact Ben @Sofas and Sectionals was nothing but very professional, SUPER prompt answering all my questions and they quoted the best price of all my options!  Every promise made was kept - price, product, quality, delivery, follow ups and even customer service!  When I inquired about delivery the rep was detailed and specific and spot on estimating when I would be called to be scheduled! Ben and the staff won my trust and my business, and I would recommend them highly! It was worth the 6 week wait to get exactly what I wanted and I know it will last a long time!  Great company to work with and great products!\\nBeautiful knives and jewelry with great craftsmanship\\nI ordered a couple of Pi Day tshirts and am very pleased with the speedy delivery using standard shipping.  The shirts are nice quality.\\nThe cupcakes arrived and almost all of the rainbows and unicorns on top had cracked and crumbled. The cupcakes themselves were good - but the presentation wasn\\'t great.\\nFairly seamless process\\nI received an email from CashNet soliciting a cash advance. As I am between paydays and had an unforeseen expense, I applied with the online application. It took about 20 minutes total. Approximately 15 minutes later I was informed that my loan/advance was approved and would be in my account with in 2 business days. Information was disseminated in a manner easy to understand and all the rights and responsibilities. Thanks for doing what you say and saying what you mean,  \\r\\n\\r\\nMarc Fulbright\\nI like the wire. Decent price. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because they sent me the wrong gauge wire. Needed 12ga. and they sent me 14ga. (Black Wire)\\nBest money we have ever spent. Great discount program.\\ngreat price for 3 games and dlc\\nOverall, our experience was great.  I have just one issue to share with you.\\nUpon our arrival, we were given a business card with this phone number:\\n414-409-7105.  When we returned from our trip, I called that number and got a recording to the effect that it was not a working number.  I then had to dig for a different number to call you to request getting picked up from the airport.  I suggest you either fix the number on the card, or simply not give the card out to people.\\n\\nThank you.\\nEasy as 1-2-3. Needed a bed frame. Ordered it. Husbands on his way to pick up.\\nReal Good people\\nI screwed up my order and was promptly notified about it. I received my order very quickly and with free shipping. They threw in a free grinder and vac seal container. These guys are great.\\nHonest descriptions of product, quick ship. No problemo.\\nAbsolutely great. Very fast and straight to the point of what I needed. Would definitely recommend this site!\\nI have ordered multiple times from Thrift Books and have never been disappointed.  I am especially pleased with the Large Print selection. I have ordered Large Print on Amazon, only to receive regular sized print, impossible for the visually impaired to read.  This has NEVER happened with Thrift Books!  I cannot recommend this seller highly enough.\\nI booked the flight from Barcelona to Casablanca and return 2 days ago for Wednesday with airlines Air Arabia. When i came to Air Arabia website to  check in, it was written that my PNR number is invalid. I am totally sure that i wrote my PNR and my data and everything right, so what is going on??? Besides, when i wanted to select my deperture, it were all cities except Barcelona... I called E-Dreams Customer Service and the man told me \"I see your reservation here so try again\". Maybe he sees it, but Air Arabia Airlines website does not! I kept doing check in again and again but it didn\\'t bring any results..it is like my reservation exists only for E-Dreams, but not for my airline.. and of course money is taken from my card! I wrote the complaint on  E Dreams but of course I didn\\'t receive the answer and my flight is in just 3 days and i really want to check in!! I have never met as dissapointing company as this one. It has really made me angry!!!\\nI love using Green Envelope! Such a fun and classy way to send email invitations.  I made an invitation for my daughter\\'s engagement party and was able to link a music file to play when the invitation was opened (Colbie Callet- I Do)-- so festive! \\nThe tracking feature works great, and I was able to follow up with the guests easily. It was nice to be able to resend the invitation with a little message to the guests who had not replied by my caterer\\'s cutoff date--and they immediately responded. \\nMy daughter\\'s matron of honor was so impressed she decided to use Green Envelope for the shower invitations. \\nI look forward to using Green Envelope again!\\nQuick and easy!

Then, he didn\\'t know enough Spanish to conduct the transaction so I did it anyway. Which wasn\\'t a problem, I preferred this since I speak Spanish but I would have appreciated if at the beginning he just mentioned that I needed another code and I could do it online or he could. That way I could have made my own choice.\\nsimple. quick. awesome.  👍\\nWe loved the way it worked out, calling after we received our luggage and became a number to verify the driver, easy pick up and a good ride.\\nTesting.com has helped my kids to acheive high scores in their academic.

The sizes are way off. And I didn\\'t order the same items twice. Would not use this site again....\\nThis company is helpful and makes sure to get you the correct thing on time. It is definitely cheaper than my normal eye dr. I will continue to use this site!\\nEvery purchase adiquirido I have more confidence to buy more and am sure it will arrive. \\r\\nThanks for giving me that feeling\\nI have ordered 3 separate times now and will continue to come back anytime I need wood letters, etc. You know exactly what you are getting before you order because it is so custom!  The price is amazing!  So the first time I ordered, I did not expect great quality because of the ease of choosing exactly what I wanted at a good price. I was wrong!!!!  The quality is excellent!!!!!  And the shipping was quick!  I am a loyal customer!\\nBest price I\\'ve found for a Litmann Cardiology IV.  Fast engraving, no errors.  Really fast shipping even using standard shipping.\\nI was completely shocked at how awesome the quality and attention to detail that was put into my order. I bought an infinity scarf for my sister in law, and it was on sale. I received a plastic envelope about 8 days later, that had a beautiful purple buttoned clutch inside labeled scarves.com on it, and inside that was my scarfs that was carefully wrapped in plastic. The scarf itself is knit and beautiful.

Being a 1st time laptop buyer, I did as much reseach as I could to find a reputable company.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy question were always answered by a live person from their CS Department, my pruchase was exactly as ordered, and the product more than met my expectations. I made a few changes to the stock configuration, and the reps I spoke with gave me excellent advice and input for my desired changes.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will do business with them again. 2 Thumbs Up!\\nI would recommend using Bookit.com because it compares all the sites in one place.

Style lasts and fit stays strong! Love these clothes!!!\\nI have been very satisfied with the company, product, and shipping associated with all my orders.  I sincerely hope the food that I\\'ve ordered is never used in my lifetime; that my reason for ordering never materializes.  But, even though I\\'m hoping for the best, I\\'m trying to prepare, as best I can, for the worst.  I\\'m buying \"insurance,\" in the hope I will never need it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, I\\'m 100 percent sure, the food ordered will not be wasted, as my kids and grandkids will be able to use the extra cushion... I will be ordering more as time and money are available.\\nInstant code delivery <3\\nWalter Drake has very good items to choose from.\\nFast and great prices.

I\\'m back home in California now, but I\\'m glad I can still get them for her.  It was simple and delivered quick.  Thanks again guys.\\nVeryy clean and convenient\\nAbsolutely a great way to book your vacation!\\nFirst time experience with Rooms Place and have already began informing our social network to look elsewhere. First impression was decent when we walked into store for first time. We saw a couch we liked and decided we would purchase at the Castleton location. There was an apparent Father’s Day sale of 20% we received. We put down $100 to hold the couch so we could go home and ensure the measurements would fit. We returned a little more than a week later to make final purchase. The original lady we worked with was not in that day. When we went to finalize things we were aggressively encouraged to buy the warranty. We said multiple times we were not interested in the warranty until we were informed if we didn’t buy the warranty the 20% discount would not apply. I found this to be completely shady and not buying the warranty and losing the discount was never mentioned in the beginning and was no where to be found in any of the written terms. I was not in the mood to fight at the time so we just purchased the warranty even though I had a feeling this was a shady practice and we were getting ripped off. We were also informed we could finance for 0% for 24 months the first time but then told it could only be for 18 months when we came back to finalize purchase. All this was one thing. Now, at this time, I’m writing this review after 9pm on a Saturday when we were told delivery would be between 3 and 6pm. We were called to let us know the delivers were hours behind and it could be as late as 8:30 but here we are at almost 9:30 with no communication and no couch delivered. At this point I’m not sure if we’ll even get the expected delivery tonight and I will be expecting a 100% refund for delivery fees and expect the couches to still be delivered. The majority of the experience with Rooms Place has been pretty pitiful since the beginning and I only hope management knows enough business and customer service sense to make things right for us. If you’re genuine about improving things and optimizing your business, there is some serious work to done and I hope it begins with correcting this experience of first time customers.\\nGood delivery\\nWrong iteam was sent.\\nShipping was a touch slower then expected but the sellers personal touches made up for that 10 fold. I would recommend again and again!\\nThe product arrived on time and as advertised. The pricing was great. I would recommend Gadget Circuit.\\nI ordered e-cards as I was in a time crunch and the site said orders would be available within 24 hours.  However, the site did not say that orders would be sent ONCE VERIFIED BY PHONE and it took 2 days for me to actually talk to someone before the vouchers were sent.  Every time I called the number noted in the email, I rec\\'d a recording saying all representatives were busy and someone would call me back.  We played phone tag (as I was at work during the day and am not allowed personal calls) for 48 hours which delayed my delivery.   The gift cards were for a basket for Nurse\\'s Week and we almost did not make the deadline---which we easily would have made if the vouchers had been sent as promised.  I still do not understand the \"verification\" process; they wanted my name, address and charge card---information that I had already provided.  I appreciated the discount on the cards, but it was not as easy getting the cards as advertised.\\nOrdered and paid for pump on Friday. Was told one day delivery. Didn\\'t come Saturday or today. (Monday)  plumbers were here today but had to send them home.\\nGood service\\nGot a $5.00 credit after spending over $2000 my first month. I was going to continue to do business with them but probably ends after receiving my last order/shipment. I got a KD Signed Basketball that had a smeared autograph. I was corrected and they said it was \"Smudged\" lol. I said, why wasn\\'t it in the description? The reply, well it shows in the picture. I was bidding on like 4 other basketballs and could\\'ve paid a little more for the same thing without the \"Smudge!\" I DIDN\\'T ask for a refund or return. I asked for a credit since I would be ordering a lot of items to finish my man-cave, give out gifts, and trades with my collector friends. But hey, I guess, my business means nothing to them...Or, maybe $5 bucks! Hope you guys hire a real manager in your customer service department that thinks long haul for repeat customers.\\nThe pricing is always the best, and the few times I\\'ve needed to return things that didn\\'t work out, it\\'s been completely hassle free. I am 100% a fan of Pure Formulas.\\nI\\'ve been waiting 2 weeks for delivery of chair. The night before it\\'s supposed to be delivered I get an email stating a time for the next day- I had a doctors appointment for that time - called to ask for a later delivery time and was told I have to wait another WEEK for my chair and STILL I WASNT GIVEN ANY OPTIONS FOR TIMES.  Hoping I\\'m able to get delivery of chair sometime this month... Won\\'t be ordering from there again.\\nAlways get great results with GigMasters.\\nHaven\\'t had blue crabs in years and Cameron\\'s did not disappoint.

Some body hijacked my account tried to transfer huge amount from my a/c... I m damn sure some body from xoom has done this... Because I use secured connection while transferring money...all the time... There is no way my credentials are leaked... Xoom customer  care sucks....they are good for nothing....

He was very professional and prompt.  He did whatever he could to assure I received  the best prices. I look forward to working with him again and have referred him/Town Fair Tire to many friends.\\nAnd if you do rent from them, DON\\'T buy their online insurance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese guys don\\'t even have a phone number for customer service.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had a very unpleasant experience with them.  The car company from which I was actually renting told me their insurance was a scam, and I could cancel it and buy theirs.  But you must cancel by one minute before the time you are scheduled to pick up the car, and if you do, you have to also give up the car reservation (and, I assume, the rate you got earlier).  And they don\\'t make it easy to cancel the insurance -- their phone number is nowhere on the email they send you confirming the reservation -- the number you see is for the actual rental company, and that company knows and understands nothing about the online insurance.  I suggest dealing directly with the local company.  I ended up double-insured and grumpy, and I will never go through them again.\\nThey were nice and the service was heart and fast. Everything ran smooth, no complaints.\\nQuick and smooth process when booking online as well as when picking up/leaving on site. We got a great almost new car for a good value.\\nI bought my first pair of glasses from firmoo and I actually bought the wrong frames. I contacted firmoo and they got back to me in a couple of hours on a weekday which I was impressed by and they helped me exchange my glasses without any issues. They dispatched the glasses with my prescription quickly too which I was also very impressed by as most online stores take atleast 2 weeks.\\n\\nUPDATE: I bought my glasses and has been roughly 2 weeks and my glasses have broken. I am very disappointment in the quality and build. I will not be buying from this company again. It was probably why they were free.\\ngreat cookbook for slow crockpot recipes, and great merchandise!\\nThis was a easy way to get what I needed. With a money back guarantee it made it even easier!\\nGreat easy experience booking. It was cheaper than the airline website too!\\nHired for a small painting project.

Shit ive not seen that ,  just adds to your bad service, as I told the first and last, customer service representative.   Never again . Will I order fro you.\\nClearBags is fast and efficient in filling orders.\\nI love this application.\\nMe and my wife loved the urn we picked out. It was a baby wrapped around with angel wings. We did run into an issue where the remains did not all fit in the urn we had ordered, but that was my mistake not asking if it would work out. I called the company and right away they took care of me and got me the size I needed made and shipped to my house on time before our daughters services. I think not many places would do that. I highly recommend this place to anyone. Thank you once again!\\nThe online course was easy to follow and convenient to do at home.\\nBest at what they do. No one else comes close. Design and marketing genius.\\nSimple to get a quote, excellent communication and courteous driver.\\nI always use Newark Airport Long Term Parking for all my vacations. They run their operation like clockwork! On this most recent trip, as soon as I retrieved my luggage, I texted them and the shuttle back to the parking lot was already there as I exited the terminal. When we arrived at the lot, my car was already waiting with the keys in the ignition. The drivers are very friendly and help with loading and unloading heavy luggage. Their excellent service is worth the slightly higher price they charge compared to other parking lots.\\nExcellent customer service , ready , willing to answer any questions you may have. Eric Erickson is an exceptional artist over the top perfessional so many compliments .\\nI found tops I can wear\\nI got what I ordered. There was an accidental extra shipment charge because they were short two of the items I ordered and they  had to send them separate.  I called and within 2 days the shipment charge was credited to my credit card:-) Very professional and kind.\\nPoor unprofessional customer service. \\nDo not value customer\\'s time.\\n\\nThe site is ok so long as you don\\'t have any issues requiring to deal with the customer service. If you have to deal with customer service, be prepared to spend hours with no resolution. Customer service is mainly interested in selling services and charging fee even if it is their fault. They will provide misleading and incorrect information.\\n\\nYou will be better off dealing directly with airlines/hotels or reputed travel sites. \\nIf somebody from the site calls you to help, please be very careful.\\nGreat choices of music shopping  but the shipping took to long to process.  I had to call customer service  to get the order processed after a week of no action.\\nThe website is easy to use and I received offers immediately! Really hoping the magician shows up for our event.\\nI recently opened a private practice and signed up for SimplePractice.  I was amazed how easy it is to use.  I really like being able to have my schedule, all the client information and my progress notes in one place.  I also like being able to add other documents such as an assessment or client plan by simply attaching them.  I also like the Option of using Stripe for credit card billing.  It was very easy to sign up and works great.\\nnice to buy somthings with phone credits\\nAlicia was very helpful.

They explained that this items sells often and they have not had any problems, so I must have gotten a bad one. I appreciated them taking the time to making it right even though I didn\\'t  ask for it.\\n\\n\\n\\nOrdered the Xbox one controller unlock tools set, took forever to get to my house and once it did the special tool to remove screws is too small and doesn\\'t work.

HUGE selection.\\nI ordered some Dancing with the Stars merchandise for my Mom for Mother\\'s Day, loved the poster, the t shirt is the kind that is way under sized, i.e. it\\'s a large and I could wear it now as a medium and after a couple of washings, it will be a regular small, so order BIGGER, the fabric  just feels cheap, I will probably return the shirt, keep the poster .\\nI order on behalf of my mother (Connie) and feel the products are of great quality and always delivered on time with step-by-step information on the delivery service.\\r\\nThank you so very much for your efficiency.\\r\\nCindy Miller\\nGreat customer service.\\n1st time buyer, I bought it one size bigger just in case the size chart was not \"accrued\" but there was no need, the dress is beautiful and perfect.

They even included a lab analysis of each product showing the results of several tests. Excellent quality, and great service. Thanks!\\nVery easy to deal with. Tickets were ready for pickup within 24 hours. A++\\nI got an email saying that my booking was canceled since the flight was not available for that price anymore. It also said that my money wasn\\'t deducted but just blocked. However, I got a notification that it was deducted. I\\'ve also read many bad reviews about Bravofly and now I\\'m worried that my money won\\'t be back within a few days. I really need it to book another flight. I\\'m writing this here because I saw that many complained about their emails not being read and not getting any reply and I hope this will be read soon. I\\'d like to get a proof of the money being released back to me and my bank being contacted to speed up things.\\n\\nUpdate: I talked to my bank to check for my money. They said I could get it back at the beginning of September. That\\'s too late! Why can\\'t you just deduct the money correctly and send it back, if you don\\'t need it instead of blocking it? That\\'s stupid! I have to travel before September! I\\'ll never ever use Bravofly again to book!!!\\nI would recommend the company to anyone.\\nGreat source for that hard to find hardware. Product came very quickly for a broken hinge in my kitchen. The hardware was of good quality and just took a minute to replace and install.

When my friend referred me to Wag I was looking for a new dog walker to help with my two doggies. I love the little perks that Wag offers, such as, lockbox, text updates, live video of walk, and friendliness of everyone I\\'ve encountered.\\nHORRIFIC and that\\'s putting it mildly. We arrived at 7pm and didn\\'t leave until 2am on New Year\\'s Eve. You have over 2000 cars parked on top of each other in various lots some marked some not, in no apparent order and on top of each other with the keys left in the car and the doors unlocked. You have no idea where any of these cars are parked. Management and many of your staff were very rude and basically could care less about all the families you left stranded. It was only because of one sympathetic employee that my car was found. It took us 20 minutes driving and walking up down several very poorly lit lots before I found my car. Some of the lots are not even paved and are covered in straw. A few of us as a last resort, called the police and when they arrived they said they come to your business for the same reason at least once a week. Your staff offered no explanation, no compensation. Whatever business model you are using, it does not work. Your greed will end up biting you in the butt. ANYONE THAT READS THIS,  DO NOT PARK YOUR CAR HERE. SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY AND GO TO A REPUTABLE PARK AND FLY LOCATION.\\nI like the service and was quick an easy everything i needed was there . I checked on other sites they were  Expensive and i found this site was the cheapest on cost an thank you .\\nI WAS CHARGE TWICE FOR SAME RENTAL\\nWhen my belts came off the track for my passenger window on my 2000 Grand Prix GT, the PartsGeek was the only place who offered the motor and the belts (brand new) for such an inexpensive price.  I will definitely use them again, for any of my vehicle needs.  Thanks guys and gals.\\r\\nRobin Cote, SSgt ret, USAF\\nI called told them about my problem. They sent a box to ship my computer.

They are perfect and of very good quality\\nThank you very much.\\nThis is a beautiful calendar, very intensely colorful and the animal pictures are fun. This artist is fantastic. The only thing I don\\'t like is that some of the background colors of the grid pages are printed dark enough that what I\\'ve written in pencil hardly shows up. But otherwise I\\'m looking forward to enjoying the bright calendar this year!\\nWe have ordered from them the past couple years, sending gifts to our customers. This year will be the last. They got more then half of the address i gave them wrong. The guy taking my order seemed bothered with me and was rude. When i called and told them half of the address\\'s were wrong she said there is nothing i can do at this one and ended the conversation. CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS. This is definitely the last time i use them.  Take my advice and dont use them!!!!!!!!!!!\\ni needed storeroom in a city i was not familar with in a hurry and sparefoot saved the day.Also saved $ being a Triple A member.\\nLove the ease and timely service. Will never buy from a bank again.\\nOrder M18H8298, Prices were outstanding on Raybans, fast shipper and real product...no counterfeit here.  Looking to purchase an extremely high-end watch.  This will be my first stop as they have so many to choose from.  I consider Jomashop a highly trusted seller.\\nPost an issue got a canned response which didnt solve my problem. Disappointed to say the least\\nSuperior product quality. The website is easy to use and my orders always ship and arrive earlier than expected.\\nHigh quality products and delivery you can count on.\\nIt is great to get reviews of businesses from those who have used them but your automated system almost pesters us users to death with the constant emails to rate this or that. It appears the just viewing the phone number of a vendor is enough to trigger the \"tidy up\" automated process and it will not stop until you have told the computer that either you did not use this vendor or give that vendor a rating. I use Angie\\'s LIst to save time but seem to spend some of my precious time responding to your computerized emails to rate a vendor I never used. Annoying. Other than that, a great service.\\nI was very skeptical at first about getting “fresh” food through the mail, but I have been pleasantly pleased so far! The food is packaged and iced well and we have received everything right on time! The meals are sent complete with all ingredients and the recipe cards are wonderful and easy to read! We are on our third package and there has been none so far that my family has not absolutely loved!! It has made cooking fun, easy and clean up is a breeze!! We will continue ordering these wonderful meals!! Thanks Hello Fresh!!\\nGreat parts and fast and friendly service.\\nI recently bought a gold bar and an American gold eagle coin; they sent me 2 emails stating that both items have the same tracking number.  I assumed therefore that the two items would be delivered in the same box; only one item came in the box.  I called and they told me that their delivery service made a mistake and they would send me the other item; the item arrived this Monday but I was not home at the time since they did not tell me the tracking number for the missed item.  USPS left me a note stating that I could pick up the item later that day; they also said that I would be charged $19.99 for shipment.  I had to call the company again; a very good woman told me that this is incorrect and she would take care of the matter.  She did; I picked up the order and now (after all of this!) everything is OK.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTwo very large mistakes; their shipping department needs to be talked to!  Otherwise, a good company.\\nThe auto we got  from AutoEurope was through Hertz from 5/3-5/14 dropping the car in Paris.  We paid the topline insurance and paid Hertz for the different drop-off location when we picked up the car in LeHavre, Fr. on 5/3.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 5/5, we received word that our son was in the Intensive Care Unit for an anticipated liver transplant in NY.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe immediately made arrangements to fly home the next morning from Milan which was the closest airport.  I checked with AutoEurope to confirm that there was a Hertz office so we could drop the car.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe drove to Milan at 5:30 am.  We were charged an additional $470 that we had to pay Hertz at the drop-off.  We had no choice - we had to get back to NY.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe only had the car for 3 days, paid the top insurance coverage, and the different drop-off fee.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIs there any way to get some compensation for using the car only 3 days out of the 11 paid for?\\nGreat site...an old dependable for hard to find items.  Do not like service charge.  Even though it\\'s been around for awhile...it seems random and pointless.  With Amazon prime as a competitor..I would rethink the charge.\\nGreat deal and have no complaints. Exactly how these companies should work\\nI shop quite significantly online so I have a lot of experience with great retailers.  Your store misses the mark a bit in terms of taking care of customers and the experience.  Case in point I spent $400 on my first order.  A coupon for 20% off comes out a few days after I order via an email from you (I just got my dresses today).  When I call they confirm the coupon will work on my dresses but they cannot provide a price adjustment (which would be almost $80).  Grrrr. How crappy is that when u send me a discount code right after I order.\\n\\nWhen I asked about sending back and reordering with discount I was informed that i will pay 10% restock. My thought is now to send them back, paying 10% to restock and to reorder the same things again. It will still save me $40 and cause you hassle handling return. That will make me feel better.\\n\\nShort of that, I will send at least one dress back.  Had you prodvided me the discount I would keep them both.  Either way, you lose a sale and a future customer.\\nOutstanding service, professionalism and value. Provided excellent information about investment.\\nI ordered gift cards from them, and had them as promised within just a couple of days.\\nThey did an excellent job of arranging all the tour entrances and were very attentive and informative during the entire experience.\\nI ordered the flowers,and they were delivered on Saturday to my sister.

Felicia was amazing and planned out our entire trip start to finish. We trusted her judgment on the tours we went on, as well as the hotels and they were all top notch. All of our transports were seamless and on time and every person we came in contact with was super nice and accommodating!We saw some of the best sights in Costa Rica and had the perfect mixture of adventure and fun with romance and relaxing. We are definitely open to going back and if anyone is thinking of going and wants a hassle free, guaranteed good time, book through Felicia Clarke with Costa Rican Vacations!\\nI have accumulated too many credits than I would like because I did not skip the month.  I\\'ve had mixed results on the quality and style of the clothes.\\nI\\'ve been with JUSTFAB for years.  I 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖them! Did i mention 💖💖💖💖💖💖 them?  I\\'ve even begun getting my little girl her clothing from fabkids. Keep up the good work JUSTFAB team,  and big hello and  hugs to Kimora Lee, please.  Stay Fabulous💋��💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖��\\nHave installed a few sets of the LEDs and all are still at full brightness unlike some competitors that start to diminish in brightness after a few months.\\nDresses,didnt fit and material was not up to standard.\\nI rented a lower category but upon arrival I got a free upgrade to a nice SEAT LEON 1.6 Turbo Diesel, the car performed very well and the service was quick and efficient, very friendly staff as well.\\nI love the service!  Searching for the book value and setting up the sell back were smooth transactions.  There was a hitch with one of my books and they got in contact with me right away to ask me what I wanted to do about it, so communication is great, too!  And the money came, just as expected!  The only thing I would improve (if it\\'s possible?...) is the book that had a hitch - on the website it passed the appraisal stage but when I sent it in I was informed that it was not an acceptable book - apparently it was a teacher\\'s edition, but it wasn\\'t apparent to me when I owned it.  So, it would have been better if in the appraisal stage the isbn would have revealed this fact about my book, rather than me proceeding with sending it in (because it was \"acceptable\") and anticipating money for it.\\nAmerican Home Shield is the worst Home Waranty company. I have had several services worked on by this company. They have the worst call wait times, very rude reps, unprofessional and not knowledgeable employees. Texas and Georgia call center employees are unhelpful. I would never recommend this company to any other person I know. They have a rating of B with the Better Business Bureau. How can they be the best warranty company for your home? They are not. This according to the internet. I hope more people read my review and continue to rate them POOR!\\nMy book came quickly, and as advertised. The price was fair.\\nLove the backsplase. Do not have it installed yet but we are very satisified with the speedy delivery and the quality of the packaging and quality of the product itself...Gary H\\nI didn\\'t recieve my check. I sent two e-mails to you. Can you contact me?\\nThey need to update their ordering system. After I ordered some product I wanted to track arrival dates. As I had placed several orders over a month, I had to choose which one to observe. This is OK but the system does not bring up the order quickly and in some cases is locks up and you have to start over.\\nI had a very pleasant experience working with Elliot Dydo, Senior Portfolio Manager at Bankers Healthcare Group.  Elliot was very informative and took time to understand our business needs. Elliot responded fully and promptly to our inquiries and questions and ensured that the loan process was very fast and thorough. I would highly recommend Elliot to colleagues for their commercial loan needs.\\nExcelent products and service, congratulation\\nBuying the furniture was nice and easy. The sales women took her time with us and was patient.  Must of sat on different couches and chairs 20 times until we narrowed it down to the ones we chose.  Delivery was a different story.  We scheduled the delivery on Thursday between 8-10 pm (which we thought was great that they had delivery that late since we both work and do not get home until 6 pm).  We received a call on Wednesday letting us know they would be there between 8-10  Wednesday night, we would not.  So we called and reschedule for Thursday again.  Needless to say the rescheduling went on until Monday when they delivered at 9:30 pm.  When it was delivered one item was missing a part, so here we went again, until that Saturday at 11:30 am when all furniture was running and at our home.  Love the furniture, could of went without the hassle.\\nNever used this site before was very easy and the prices were way lower than any other site I could find!\\nMy price sign is well made and exactly as advertised\\nGreat service!\\nBags came in looking great - just wished the ink had been darker and more vibrant.\\nFast, easy and to the point.  Rest assure you got the best flight a the best price at the moment with just a couple of clicks.\\nThe purchase itself went smooth. The problem was trying to reach customer service in order to know the shipping dates of the product i bought. First they sent me an incorrect tracking number. Later when i try to reach them through live chat, they barely responded, even seemed very rude from the person that responded. So basically nobody gave any information about the shipping status until i received the shipping confirmation, which was already to late. Disappointing experience.\\nVery Helpful and returned my call after I had a question great customer service\\nAVANT CAME TO MY RESCUSE AND HELPED ME ... THE EXPERIENCE WAS VERY REWARDING AND EASY.\\nIt\\'s a great comfort to know we have food stored for an emergency.\\nI have not had a claim so therefor I have no option has of yet.\\nTrust pilot has some charlatans.\\n\\nThere is a strong element of buyer beware, that is as one example, you will get contractors who simply give you a very high estimate then hire out the work. \\n\\nBe careful to read the reviews, hopefully, that lessons much of the risk.\\nVery quick delivery of my order, with the book in very good condition, thank you.\\nI am bying strings and accessories from them for some years now, never had a problem. I would recommend this store.Way more choice that i can find in stores in my city.\\nEasy and fast, military trying to get home for the holidays, no issues\\nGood service\\nThe 12 days of Christmas sale was great.  I could not wait till the next day to see what was on sale.  The winch accessory kit was a great buy.\\nI have been ordering products from Pure Formulas for quite some time, and have never, ever had an unpleasant experience with them. They have marvellous products, expedient service and very helpful and happy customer service reps.  Pure Formulas is by far the very best!  Cheers!\\nThis course was very helpful to take. I loved it.\\nWe love using priceline we always get exactly what we put in for.\\nI have just spent the last hour trying to log into my \"corset story\" account & contact customer service to request a return without success. I am extremely frustrated hence this review. I have tried calling customer services, using the number listed for  customer service on the website which is unobtainable. I then sent an e-mail to which I got a response advising me to change my password. I have changed my password three times today and am still unable to request a return. As this is the only way to return goods it looks as if I will miss the 14 day dealine within which returns have to be requested. Am beginning to think this is a ploy to prevent goods being returned. First time using this company and I won\\'t be using them again. Can anyone advise alternative means of returning goods to them?\\nGreat product!\\nThe delivery and install were very fast. The RC Willey team that delivered and installed my bedroom set were very professional and kind. They did a great job\\nGreat prices!  Great customer service!  Great products! Thank you for coming to DFW!\\nThis is the second time I\\'ve used LiveAgent and should there ever be a need for a third for a new venture, it\\'s a no brainer.\\nI received  the rest of my order today,securely packaged. \\nLovely quality mug and mouse pad. I am very happy with. Thank you.\\nGot what I wanted at a third of the price that Amazon.com had for the same item.\\nYour customer service is the worse and if you want to chat with you, you are never available and your product didn’t even turn on I wanted to get a return stamp and your website wouldn’t do it taking me back and fort. I want my money back, are you a phony company?\\nMy experience was great and I would highly recommend them.  We received clear and concise information and they provided us with the best rates possible.  I felt that my husband and I were cared for and that our best interests were at the heart of everything.\\nBought tickets for 2 laker games both went very smooth\\nShipping confirmation hasn\\'t been updated since 8/12/14.   Today is 8/17/14.  Haven\\'t even received my purchase yet!\\nI went online to find a company that could make lapel buttons.  I came across the Affordable Button ad and gave them a try.  It took only two correspondence emails to send and view the proof plus the byline.  Approved the proof and had the buttons in a very short time.  They turned out perfect.  Fortunately for them, other people saw the buttons and want them too, which means another order needs to be placed.\\nI used to go to Supplement Warehouse when I lived in Wisconsin, and because they are such a great company I kept ordering from them after I left the state for the military and was stationed in California. Their shipping is always fast, their selection is huge, and their price match is great! Would recommend to anyone looking for quality supplements at a good price.\\nI had a awesome experience! Very helpful with all my questions. Mrs. Anna was a delight to talk to and made the process very easy! Definitely glad I chose to go with this company! Thank you again for your help!\\nFree shipping???? Seriously? Yes!! I couldn\\'t believe it! Absolutely free shipping on a relatively inexpensive purchase. I was delighted to say the least. The entire transaction was top notch. Quick delivery! I will definitely be a returning customer.\\nPetflow makes it so easy to not have to worry about running out of dog or cat food with their automatic shipments.  I also love that you can use manufacturers coupons as well by contacting customer service. Prices are competitive too and free or reduced price shipping is another added bonus!\\nUsed the company for both Florence and Rome. Ignacio, Damiano and Anna were all superb. Friendly warm  informative made you feel that you were a friend they were taking around, rather than just doing a job. Highly recommended.\\nI appreciate the ability to get my answers answered quickly and accurately. Although I have only been using TherapyNotes for five months, it has really streamlined my practice and allows me to focus on counseling and less on documentation and billing. I love it!\\nGreat service. Received flags quickly with no issues.\\nUsed for service from LaGuardia to Midtown Manhattan and back. No problems with service. Cars were on time, clean. Both directions the drive called to say they had arrived. Easy to track car location. Will use again.\\nGreat customer service!\\nStill waiting for my order to arrive.\\nEasy to follow. Also, educational and recommended for all.\\nIt was easy to read through and I had plenty of time to answer questions.  Just follow directions and it goes by fast.\\nTwice I have received an order that was incorrect.  First, the restaurant, a pizza place of all things. did not have an option to create a plain old double pepperoni pizza.  So,  in special instructions, wrote \" I purchased a $5 salad i don\\'t want.  I did this because I see no option to add pepperoni to my cheese pizza.  So, don\\'t make the salad, I don\\'t want it.  It is to cover (way more than cover) double pepp for small pizza.  It\\'s written in two places with two phone numbers for questions.  NO pepp.  Grub hub refused to do anything.  Tonight, said I ordered extra ANCHOVIES I hate them.  $40 order, they offer $10.  SHAME ON YOU GRUB HUB...and every other company who shoves responsibility onto each other futher frustrating the customer.  I order twice a week minimum.....never again.  Grub Hub has cheap practices.  Hope it was worth it.  You are absolutely miserable.  GO AMAZON< EAT @$< CAVIAR DOOR DASH< SEAMLESS   GRUB HUB IS AS VULNERABLE TO YOU AS UBER WAS TO LYFT---------------CAPITALIZE------hit \\'em while they\\'re down because so is their level of professionalism and ability to properly support clientele\\nnice razor !!!\\nOrdered two Christmas gifts.  One received, one not. Quality of fruit was good.  Customer service awful!!  If something goes wrong with an order, they will make it right, but it takes at least three days to get to talk to someone.  One Christmas gift never received, they will replace it, but not till mid January.  They said it was damaged and could not be delivered, but never notified us.   No apology, no credit, just rudeness.  Will we order again?  Not sure.  Depends if Christmas gift gets there mid January and if fruit is good.\\nExcellent service .keep it up\\nAllison was super helpful, make sure you ask for her!\\nAt first I was quite happy to discover PartsGeek on-line to supply parts for my total re-build of a 1993 Eurovan.  Their web site was easy to use and to find the parts I needed so I ordered a large number of parts.  Unfortunately, the first time I had a question about a certain part I was only able to contact this group on-line and even though I tried several times my question was never directly answered.  Next, one of the parts I received - one of two tie rod ends - did not fit because the inner threads had not been cut correctly.  It was obviously a manufacturer\\'s problem but again, I could only contact PartsGeek via the web and was not able to talk with someone directly about the problem.  Even the phone number given on the web site resulted in a recorded message telling me to  contact them through the web.  I applied for a \"return item\" number and wrote an explanation of the problem but the process was treated as if I had ordered the wrong part and was my fault.  I had to pay the shipping costs to return the part and then was charged a re-stocking fee.  That was bad enough but I had a feeling that the information about the problem part would be lost and the part would be returned to the shelf and re-sold, causing the same problem for the next person.  This suspicion was confirmed when I was ready to install the water pump I bought from PartsGeek.  When I received the pump via UPS I had opened the box and took a quick look inside and the pump looked fine.   The part sat in the box while I worked on the engine.  When I finally took the part out I realized that it had been sold to someone before - there were bolt/washer pressure marks on the install holes - and been returned.  The problem was that the pump had been returned with the first buyer\\'s used, rusty and brittle O-ring and no one at PartsGeek bothered to notice.\\r\\nMy bad experiences would not have happened if  PartsGeek had an effective Customer Service department where a customer can contact a real, live person on the phone an discuss and resolve problems.  Until PartsGeek does this I will not buy parts from them and will caution others to do the same.\\nI like everything, except one thing. To have more comps in Las Vegas location, especially for the shows. We go to Vegas at least twice a year, and I always go to gold star first to look at the shows.\\nWas very quick in processing my sale\\nI appreciate all the simple, easy-to-read facts that CompareCards offer.  Each week CompareCards presents articles to teach the average consumer, like myself,  pros and cons of the credit card.  I highly recommend using CompareCards.com to find the best credit card for your individual need.  I trust CompareCards!\\nI am very happy with the front rotors and pads I received from you. I beleive that your spot on with quality, price and shipping time.\\nFivestars has been a wonderful tool for our small business.

I am truly disappointed and will not be purchasing any more groupons.\\nBible Marker pens work great on fine Bible paper... no bleeding thru.\\nOrdering, easy, initial notification, no problem, feedback could be improved.  I inquired as to the status of my order after a couple of days and the next day I got a shipping notice but they never replied to my inquiry.  In general I am happy.  I got what I ordered in about 10 days.\\nAlways accurate, always on time.\\nOrdered 2 big bags of Canidae, arrived in perfect condition in 2 days.  I will definitely order from Petflow again.\\nWe own a B&B. For years, room names were displayed in small frames next to each room. I simply love having room names on the doors in a 3 inch font. No confusion as to where to go. Ordering and application were easy.\\nGary and Farah were both very thorough and efficient. Very pleasant and knowledgeable.\\nExcellent customer service all around! Andrea Mendoza was outstanding - very prompt in responding and very helpful.\\nLove the styles & variety of all these puzzles. They keep coming out with interesting subject matter and new designs to keep things fresh, yet cherish the older models/favorites as well. Also value the interlocking quality. Fun, fun, FUN!\\nI was satisfied\\nWould give a 5 stare buy the part was late on being shipped. When you are waiting on parts to fix your heater/a.c. And don\\'t have another car or truck to get around in with your 1 year old it puts you I  a bind..\\nVery transparent. Accessible and easy use.\\nMy jellybeans are wonderful, but because I cancelled the first two original orders, on the phone, then combined the two orders together, I still have a pending transaction with Paypal, which I hope resolves itself.  My transaction from 2-28-18 is still pending with them, so hope that Miles Kimball got everything straightened out with the orders.  I will inform you if not.\\nThis is the 2nd time I\\'ve ordered from Words Anywhere for my office.  I\\'ve used my \"words\" to designate all of our conference rooms on an inside wall.  We even created some inspirational phrases for key areas of our work space.  It\\'s very easy to design creations, they came quickly and they are very easy to apply! Will absolutely continue to order from here.\\nDoorbell cam stopped recording within a year and front door key lock battery dies within days but don\\'t use it...\\nGreat product, user friendly setup, easy communication interface with employers\\nIt was very tender but too salty to eat.

However, the words were much smaller than in the pictures and on a completely different part of the mug.

No complaints.\\nHe was awesome, patient with me with all my changes with the dates .Thanks\\nJustFab has an amazing selection of shoes and their customer service is amazing! The only thing that I would change would be the fact that you can\\'t choose the same subscription of offered magazine and if you choose a subscription and then don\\'t end up getting it delivered, you can\\'t choose it again so that kind of sucks. But all in all, Just Fab has quality products and an amazing return policy also. I love it!!\\nMy auto ship orders are very convenient arriving at my front door on schedule.  PetFlow has everything you could possibly need or want for your pets.\\nVery energetic and funny tour guide (Jake) who made the trip more interesting. This is a long day trip, with a lot of driving (around 8 hours return).\\nThe course content is good and exhaustive, and more importantly, the support teams are quite responsive and available to answer your queries. The PRINCE2 course, which I took, has some helpful tips and they are really professional. Thumbs up!\\ngreat experience\\ni love hobbylinc, they have all my needs and r real easy to order from. i would and regularly suggest hobbylinc, and i intend to keep using them for my future purchases.\\nI didn\\'t like that the offer of free shipping was rendered null and void because the items were on sale.  i would have saved more had they been regular price and I could have the free shipping.  I felt that this was done on purpose.\\nThey were excellent to work with. I initially ordered the wrong product on accident.  They fixed my order immediately.  I paid for expedited shipping and the product came faster than called for.  I would do business with them again in the future.\\nEasy to use good deals much appreciation\\nI loved the idea of a really cute license plate holder and purchased one that looked like Kate Spade would have designed it.  I was notified that it had shipped and that I could expect it on a certain date.  That day came and went with no word.  I sent an email wanting to get a status and got a reply back saying sorry and they would send a replacement but no status.  When it did arrive I loved the color but not how flimsy the item is.  It is definitely not worth $20.  Maybe $10 for the originality factor but that is it.  No, I would not recommend to a friend.\\nPerfect Transaction\\nIt was fast and simple\\nBetter than expected goose costumes-I bought 3 and they\\'re all good quality, especially the squirrel. \\nThank you!\\nrenting a car can not be easier\\nWe rented five seat car, but later on needed to change for seven seat. I have made a phone call and the gentleman handled the swap. When we arrived, there was no car what so ever. After THREE HOURS on the phone with their customer service we were informed they do not have any seven seat car and there is nothing they can do. \\nAt the end we were forced to pay for another car (it was only a pure luck there was another person with driving license). \\nI have made a formal complaint. The manager of Rentalcars claimed we used both cars so there is no refund in force. Well, they were the ones who made a mistake, failed to deliver the correct car, had no clue how to fix the problem, were not willing to fix it but where more than happy co charge me for another car!! \\nVery uncivilized manners and unprofessional behavior. \\nNever again. \\nHire yourself a car directly, that is the best piece of advice I can give you.\\nAll good but didn\\'t receive any notifications about order, status, shipping until I emailed a week later and the shipment arrived the next day, just like to know if everything was in order\\nIt was very proficient\\nI had some mats cut and was happy with the final product, but they were custom and I had a fair bit of frustration along the way.  I began by going to the shop hoping they could easily help me with 3 different designs, but I ended up wasting 45 mins on each of 2 different trips.  I ended up designing the layout on my own on my laptop.  \\n\\nI was very surprised they don\\'t have software to help with this.  I also suspect that a new employee was working with me, and I think someone more experienced should have noticed that she/we needed help and come to the rescue.\\nI like the Epsom salt rub very much.\\nGreat website, helpful information, easy booking.  Highly recommended.\\nI had no issues at all with JustFly. The price was the best I could find and all flights were exactly as advertised. Without a doubt, I would book through JustFly again.\\nI was able to locate and order what I wanted in a matter of a few minutes, no hassles or frustration.  They had the exact product I needed.\\nThe goods were accurately portrayed and promptly delivered.\\nI was very pleased with the punctuality of the driver.  I will take Dial 7 again and I will also recommend them to family and friends.\\nI was looking for a watch for some time already and I had seen it on Jomashop.com but I never made the approach to buy it. After some time I gabe it a chance and bought it.

I\\'ll certainly use your company again and recommend you to my friends.\\nVery satisfied with my experience.\\nI only recently discovered Thrift Books and I absolutely love it. I have ordered over 14 or so books from them already and have always been impressed with there great deals and great delivery. They have free shipping on orders over $10 which saves me so much money and the fact that they use recycled packaging is a plus. I will continue using Thrift Books to add to my personal library because of the great prices and the excellent service. Thrift Books is amazing!\\nThe print is fantastic and is as beautiful as the portrayal on the website.  However, this is the second print I have received from ICanvas that had no hanger installed on the print. The first time, I thought I missed the option when ordering but I was very careful the next time to make sure and there was no option.  I had to go out and buy a hanger and it was very disappointing to not be able to hang it as soon as it arrived.\\nVery easy to find airlines with.\\nThis location is all star! Very accommodating, helpful and keep the place up!\\nMy Rep Dan was fantastic!! He listened to my needs and was very responsive to them. He price matched without hesitation. This was truly a great experience. This is my 3rd car I\\'ve brought here in the past 3 months and I\\'ll come here moving forward with all my tireviews needs.\\nEasy to book and always has great deals!\\nFast shipping, very happy\\nAfter checking a few different sites, I found JustFly.  I found the best rates with minimal stops for my trip.\\nI\\'ve purchased a couple of watches from Jomashop. Both instances featured FAST shipping (as in receiving the products within 2 days), well packaged products, with expected touchpoints (email receipts, when it shipped, tracking, etc). I wouldn\\'t hesitate to buy from them again.\\nI\\'m a huge fan of the IdealBoost drinks. My favorite flavor is the Tropical. It\\'s light and refreshing. This drink is my \"wake up\" drink and helps me get up and moving in the morning.\\nWhen we got to our cabin there were a few things that needed to be addressed and the stag was quick to resolve them. Cabin was very clean and well maintained and the check in process via text message was great! No having to go to the office and wait in lines to sign a piece of paper! They will be our go to place for cabin rentals in the future!\\nI was had a surgery, so i have to cancel my tickets, I already spend almost a week to used online chat, phone call to cancel my tickets. First, they said can\\'t cancel my tickets even i had a surgery, I was really shocked, so i called the Airasia told them all my situation also send email for tham to provide it my surgery file, after Airasia agree with me to refund, but need KIWI.COM contact with them, after finished call, i called KIWI.COM but different customer support just told me need waiting 3~4 hours and another one told me will contact in 4 hours and i keep waiting over and over again also they promised me will contact with Airasia for cancel my tickets every single time, and after i called Airasia to make sure KIWI.COM contact yet or not, they told me no one called them, no email send for them, i really confused so i called the KIWI.COM again, however,  they told me already called also send email for tham, but it was not truth! I don\\'t understand why need waiting so long and why lie to customer just for one call? Today customer support told me will contact me in 4 hours,,,, but now ,,, already over 6 hours, still no one contact me,, please, just please don\\'t lie to customer alright! I already used a week to cancel my tickets now i only have 4 days to cancel my tickets..        \\n I THINK KIWI.COM IS AN IRRESPONSIBLE COMPANY.\\nExcellent service and very professional\\nVend has been fantastic for our small retail outlet with seasonal customers.\\nPositive;\\n - free to use until you exceed a certain number of items\\n - integrates with Paypal Here seamlessly. No faffing about trying to input passwords or get the reader to connect. Piece of cake.\\n - excellent reporting for stock\\n - VAT can be set per item\\n - clean interface and easy to use.\\n\\nNegative;\\n - Bit time consuming to extract customer emails but not a huge pain considering the positives.\\nVery rigid, I booked the ticket online 2 minutes later realized that I did not put in my full middle name, called to the customer service immediately, had to wait for fifteen minutes then be told that it’s not possible to do changes therefore cancelled the ticket with a penalty of $75.00 and rebook again with a higher ticket price. I calculated it at the end it would be better off to book with the airline direct without having to deal with all the hassle.\\nThis is my first time and would be my last time to book through this website.\\nDriver was great.  Arrived when promised and delivered within window.  Will use again.\\nI must admit I was nervous ordering a 1.77 carat ring online.  However, the ring is everything Brilliance said it would be.  My fiancé and I have verified the ring is authentic and exactly as advertised.  We took the ring to two different local jewelers.  Both the representatives at the jewelry stores where very impressed with the ring, as are most people that see the ring.  Both of the jewelers told me they couldn’t beat the price I paid for the ring.  I also was able to see the GIA laser inscription under a microscope at the jewelry store.  My fiancé was adamant about not ordering a ring online.  However, the diamond we bought is almost a full carat larger than similarly priced rings we saw at major, name brand jewelry stores.  My fiancé and I couldn’t be happier.\\r\\n\\r\\nKeep in mind, rings ordered during the holidays may take a few days longer to be delivered.  GIA laser inscription can take up to ten days; Brilliance has no control over this.  The wait is well worth it. I am a very satisfied customer.\\nMarcus was great.\\nGood service, good product\\nWhat a wonderful staff they have at Thomas Dean....I had a problem with my order and the website said no one is in sat or sunday. I sent an email and sure enough 2 hours later on a Saturday Laurie called me back and fixed my problem. Thank you for making my holiday shopping so much easier!!!\\nAwesome belt !

Same day delivery and setup for a minimal fee.

The emblem was vibrant and well fixed to the cloth.\\nWhenever I need to buy something I always head to the Amazon marketplace first because they have a huge selection of items to pick from and they are usually cheaper than what you would pay at the store. Other than being affordable you can see which items are actually high quality because of the reviews that other users leave for them, which I always pay attention to.  I also love the fact that I get all of my items in two days thanks to prime and I never have to worry about shipping costs.\\r\\n\\r\\n I do usually avoid furniture and other bulky items from Amazon because there is usually a shipping cost and it\\'s normally pretty high.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Update July 2015\\r\\n\\r\\nSince writing my original review I can happily say that I\\'ve purchased a night stand, a large sewing table, a Futon Frame, a few mattresses and a bunch of other bulky items from Amazon. With my prime membership shipping was free on each of these items and the price of them beat out every other option available. It\\'s hard to beat that, especially when you add in how fast Prime shipping is.\\nBuying a domain is easy, and Customer Service is always friendly.\\nThe prices are competitive and 1&1\\'s level of service is FAR better than that of GoDaddy\\'s.\\nThe 20g was put into affect after I became a customer so when they changed to a limit I was greatly suprized I was never told about this prior to the change nor properly explained to this date why they put the limit and throttle back my download\\'s.\\nI will order more of these belts. So simple, so light, yet so durable. I have multiple coworkers in the fire service that are interested in the belts as well. Look great with daily uniforms.\\nThe overall experience was quite good.  Check in was easy and efficient.  When I arrived back in Newark, I was picked up immediately and my vehicle was ready with the trunk open for my luggage.  My only complaint was that I had paid the $30 + fees for the premium car wash wash, and that was terrible if done at all.  The car was dirty and windows poorly cleaned.  So, next time I don\\'t get that.  Otherwise, a good place to park.\\nFast delivery very easy to order and find books\\nJulian P.\\nCustomer support\\nChat started\\nkiya beard\\nSo our boss Gary young ordered us food from City BBQ and I called City and they said their driver left 35mins ago.

I am still waiting for products that I ordered in August.\\r\\nI am not sure why is it taking this long to ship items.\\nEvery professional contractor recommended have been professional and very efficient.\\nWebsites are not cooperative, they ask for details and seemingly never act once the data is input.  Lot of failures to take the information.\\nI bought a really cute necklace for my daughter with her and her boyfriends names on it. She really loved it. It did break after a couple months, but i have to say when I contacted customer service, they quickly replaced it with a brand new one with no cost to us! I would def buy from them again especially knowing that they are willing to stand by their jewelry if it  breaks!\\nI got help from Sherrill Kalupa from your firm, and it was a wonderful experience. She was professional, knowledgeable, and friendly. I was at ease throughout this whole experience. I would definitely recommend anyone who would be interested in inventing precious metals to speak with her.\\nAfter I booked a car, I changed my mind and needed a different one.

I absolutely recommend if you want to have a fun bathroom just go for it!\\nThe rug is nice. Its not what I thought the fabric would be. Its difficult to tell be a picture.\\nI had posted a 3 star review ... see below ... But I am amending my view of this company on account of their great customer service and stellar plant guarantee. I will definitely shop with them again...and with confidence that if I have ANY problems that the folks in customer service will really pull through! Great job! Great company!!   OLD REVIEW---I regularly shop by mail order for my garden plants, so I have experience with this type of business. Of 25 plants ordered, only ten were in good condition upon arrival. 3 were badly damaged by improper packing, 1 more was broken at the base and was beyond survival. The plants clearly had not been watered for some time ahead of shipping and arrived in very stressed condition. They were immediately unpacked, watered and put in a dappled shade situation to allow to recover from shipping shock, which took five days rather that the usual two or so. Still, in total, 5 plants did not survive. I can not recommend this company.\\nAllison was very helpful. It would have been much more difficult without her.\\nOrdering great. Speed of delivery great. Quality of products very very poor. Atleast two-thirds of my order were split cracked or missing large chunks.\\nGreat service. Cards looked great and arrived fast.\\nThey gave me a good price for my books but it took a lot longer to get paid than I expected or even what was initially promised.  Expected it to take 5 to 7 business days but it took almost three weeks.\\nI just realized Before I push the checkout button that I didn’t get the deal and it said the two pants for $24\\nI love how easy the site is to use either on my phone or laptop. I think I the branding is great and love that celebrities like Demi support this company. I have never had a problem with Fabletics and they consistently continue to be one of my all time favorite brands.\\nquick and easy\\nYour site was easy to shop, I found everything I was looking for at very good prices.  Product was delivered in 2 days and the product was just what I wanted.\\nGreat value to explore New York city\\nI use Pure Formulas because  of the free shipping, which is always a plus. They carry a few of the vitamins I use on a regular basis. \\nThey are quicker than normal, also a plus.\\n\\nKind Regards,\\nNancy G\\nWe have ordered our 5-year calendars from this company the last two times.  Will continue to as long as we need them.\\nUPS lost our package and Dental Planet took care of it immediately. My package was late but at no fault to them, I would recommend buying from Dental Planet!\\nI got everything I needed to get within a day and they were so much cheaper than the other websites.\\nive never flown out of Newark since I live near philly, but LTP made my experience easy and efficient. They were friendly and quick to get us to the airport and pick us up. I will definitely use them again if I fly out of Newark.\\nQuality products, prompt service, good pricing.  The rug pads are excellent.\\nGood customer service and support but I was disappointed that the tickets I purchased weren\\'t labeled as obstructed view.\\nwell i ordered some stuff to restore a truck its a 1959 ford f100 and i needed brake drums brake cylinders brake shoes and some hardware, pretty much standard stuff. so i ordered it all and i had ordered two front drums and two rear drums. but what they had sent me was 4 rear brake drums. then when i contacted the company about exchanging them for the front drums that i needed, they insisted that i was wrong and that they were right. no matter that i sent them a picture of the 4 brake drums that all had the same part number. the part number on the 4 i had was 123.65000 and i needed two of part number BD160. they then told me that they were out of the ones that i wanted and that they sent me two front ones at a lower price for the inconvenience. now i cannot get ahold of them at all, and the last thing i was told was that i was stuck with an extra set of rear brake drums and that i was going to have to purchase the front ones (that i had already paid for) \\r\\n\\r\\nmoral of the story DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY terrible customer service and their morals are questionable at best.\\nVery easy and efficient tool for the last minute and even before.\\r\\n\\r\\nExcellent.. Must know it.\\nim not recevid my order\\nAlways quick turnaround and great personal service.\\nI have now ordered multiple items form American RV.  I have been satisfied each time by the products received, even the \\'reconditioned\\' one.  When I had an issue with the shipping charges AmRV Customer Service took the time to explain the costs, the breakdowns and why it cost that month.  Add to this the fact that the total cost from AmRV was about 75% of what the local RV dealer wanted for the same part.\\nI purchased an ac compressor from this company. I took the car to the mechanic and he said that there should have been an orfice tube and accumulator. They sold me this product where I  assumed that it was the best price which included  the orfice tube and ac accumulator. The sales person did tell me that I needed these items because they were not included. This is unethical and deceptive advertising.\\nI like the clothes, and the prices seem good for the quality. I went to a pop-up store in Phoenix not long ago (drove 2 hours to get there) and was disappointed in the set-up. There were no long mirrors, only a \"skinny\" mirror propped on a chair. It elongated my body, so I had to rely on my daughter\\'s picture-taking skills with my phone to see how the clothes actually looked on me. It didn\\'t work, so I didn\\'t buy anything. Your pop-ups should have tall, regular ol\\' mirrors.\\nI enjoyed using Aceable although the content of the lesson is on the boring side. The only thing for me on the downside was that it took me much more than 4 hrs to do. Maybe it\\'s just me?\\nFast service; great prices!\\nExcellent- car was kept safe and they got us to where we needed to be on time\\nSent the wrong part  then wanted me to drive out of town to send it back pay for shipping and restock fee. For only half of what I paid for\\nRead some of the reviews and one mentioned taking a picture of the tumbler, which led me to finding the code I needed to order a replacement key for our file cabinet. Arrived within a week and now I am compliant with the law by locking up our new personnel files! Thank You!\\nFast, reliable,and easy to work with.I have a 2011 Toyota Rav4 that I now know has a 2009 transmission. It took several tries to find that out,but Parts Geek took all the wrong parts back,and worked me through the event.\\nbest music old and new from over the world\\nThe store manager provided EXCELLENT customer service and made sure that I got my mattress and bedframe on time - he delivered my bed personally. I would recommend American Freight to anyone in need of furniture - you can\\'t go wrong! I absolutely love my bed and my frame - I got the \"Lila\".\\nExcellent service.\\nTo make the three cards was very easy. I just uploaded a picture for each card I made and had them sent to our son. What I really like is that they can use them for whatever they want. They are not restricted to a store gift card.\\r\\nI would do it again in a heartbeat.\\nOrdered a new iPad and had a mistake on my end related to the shipping, they did everything in their power to correct my mistake!\\nHonestly one of the easier sites to use and I didn\\'t feel pressure to purchase right away and lose my seat. I made a better decision because of that.\\nI’ve been a mypoints member for several years and the gift cards you earn are legit and your information is confidential. Thank you!\\nI have had the pleasure of mostly dealing with Matt, Randy, and Kyle.  They have all been excellent to work with.  They are very attentive to what the organization needs and are very detailed in the test/inspection paperwork.  Their goal is to keep me compliant, not just to get the job done.  That is such a big deal in healthcare.\\nExcellent and friendly web site booking\\nSkimo is a great store, with an extensive, well-considered selection of products, backed up by stellar customer service.\\nOverall the content covered enough material to get you a passing mark. However the publisher could have done a better and more thorough job of ensuring the words and phrases used matched with the words and phrases that Transport Canada uses. Where it did not match it caused confusion and uncertainty in making the correct multiple choice selection. \\n\\nI passed with a 94% but I used my full time allotment to struggle over some of the confusing questions.\\nThis is my first order very excited to see the product!!\\nThe site is always great, but this year at the beginning of the school year you shouldn\\'t be out of black hotel pans.\\nPerfect quality, fast delivery, best prices\\nBoth were a huge hit with my kids.

Moreover, you and your team have been best in customer support..\\nAs a Lyft driver, I absolutely enjoy my job! I meet so many different people, and learn so many new things. Additionally, it affords me to be able to be a full-time mom by day and rideshare driver by night.\\nOur trip to Southwest Ireland was lovely, however it would have been nice to know that Easter Holiday was falling the same week as our travel.  Our Shannon hotel was overrun with children and while we love children, would have preferred to have had an option to upgrading our hotel.   All of the hotels, with the exception of Limerick, were very nice and Limerick was just small with no door or parking assistance.   All in all, for the first time using TravelZoo and Great Value Vacations, I would use both again.\\nHas everything I want from my scotties to my Star Trek and everything in between. They\\'ve also made my personalized Scottish Terrier T-Shirts that my husband and I wear all the time and I\\'m planning on making my own photo blankets for Christmas!\\nExcellent Service! Excellent Products!\\nColin Buley was great. Was able to find me a close install date at a much less cost to install than other companies. Would highly suggest giving Colin a call when you need anything done.\\nThey make you pay for a return they list things that are not actually compatible with cars and take forever to help you\\nThey have a nice selection of games, especially older ones and I love them for being DRM-free! They also treat developers a lot better than their competitors do.\\n\\nMany games also work on Linux however I\\'d be happier if they offered even more Linux support.\\n\\nTheir prices aren\\'t bad either!\\nMaking the reservation went without a hitch, it was fast and easy, and I would use this site again, and will use it again in the future\\nThe process has been great so far.  I am almost a year in and have completely paid one account off.  I have few that will be paid off within the next 6 months. I still have quite a ways to go but overall I am satisfied with the progress\\nBoots are great quality and soooo wonderfully priced!!! Will definitely shop here in the future.\\nHighly recommend very quick and friendly service\\nThe girls are always so nice and happy.\\nThey dont give me my money not even winnings i dont talk about winnings.\\n\\ni dont care about site and maybe about design but when i play there long time back i got stolen money and this is very bad its not  gud\\nGREAT SEARCH ENGINE. i love it\\nI called looking for help resurrecting my old vaporizer and left with a fabulous brand new one. I couldn\\'t be happier. In all honesty, while I am on a budget, I really didn\\'t enjoy using my old one even when it was new so I was pretty excited to get a replacement! After chatting with the associate and sharing how I would love to have a Volcano, he pointed me to one that is similar and not nearly as pricey. It arrived super fast which is always a plus. It was a great suggestion and I\\'ve enjoyed all of the accessories that it comes with.\\nYou made a lifetime customer.\\ngood course well put together seems legit\\nPrompt shipment, item as described and competitively priced.\\nTheir website is easy to use and the items I ordered arrived in a very short time and were well packaged.\\nWow to be honest I have bought tickets from most of the major resellers and you guys were by far the WORST my agent Carson Farmer was useless.  I bought my tickets to a Green Bay Packer game in June, I was travelling from Toronto Canada to Green Bay Wisconsin, and finally received my tickets via email (you charged me for shipping) 2 days before I got on a plane to go.  You guys never notified me that my tickets were available it was me calling your company, and finally getting somebody on the phone, I believe his name is Tyler who is able to get me the tickets emailed. I will never use your company again, and I will definitely be telling people I know never to use your company. A brutal experience, I’m only Being honest. \\nDavid Kendal\\nGreat experience\\nExceptional service.........!\\nI got some good stuff from these folks !!!\\nThe agent was very pleasant..to the point and help me right away.\\nrefer me to a great Dentist\\nThe website has clear instructions and is very easy to work through. The whole booking took less than 5 minutes beginning to end.\\nMy experience at Drive Time was well worth my time!  I was treated with respect, dignity, and patience as I carefully chose the car of my desire!  The staff there at Drive Time were friendly, courteous, and attentive to my needs as a potential customer.  I am impressed with the refer a friend program and will be referring people to Drive Time to take advantage of having my payments made for referring a buying customer.  I want to especially thank my salesman and manager Lamont at the Fairfield store in Cincinnati, Ohio for being so patient and courteous with me :)\\nDouble charged after a reservation wasn\\'t used by their staff properly. Called customer service and was actively antagonized by an extremely rude manager who did not resolve the situation.\\nMy experience was amazing with CardKangaroo. The process was easy, and after paying, I got a phone call confirmation within minutes, and my gift card about 5 minutes after. Overall, from payment to receiving the card, everything was super smooth and quick. In total, the card took about 15 minutes after payment to arrive. I had tried Cardpool right before I tried this site, and not only did they take 24 hours to \"process\" everything, they sent me an email saying their risk assesment team wouldn\\'t process my payment, so that was a huge waste of time. Comapred to that, CardKangaroo was amazing.\\nGood clean interface with multi-country options\\nAlways such a quick turn around with plenty of reminders about your payment due dates.\\nCan\\'t wait to order more books from Thrift!\\nPetbest called me to inform me that the product was out of stock and the auto-fill delivery would be late.

I received discounts and free shipping. The item was delivered efficiently. The necklaces came just as I was hoping them to look like. quality looks very good. the little bags the necklaces came in was perfect! didnt even need to go out to buy a box for it. very impressed. will be coming back this website if I need to order again!\\nVery easy to order and received shirt promptly.   Will definitely be a repeat customer.\\nI like this website because I am a disabled veteran who can\\'t easily get out to buy food for my three cats and I hate finding out that I only have one can or one last bowl of dry food left. Once I get down to half of my supply I am able to order online and know that I will receive my order before I run out. My only complaint is that I use Meow Mix and I did not see it when I went to order it on the web site. Maybe I missed it but I need it so if I can\\'t get it from PetBest I will have to discontinue ordering from them and look elsewhere so I hope I just missed it when I did my first order! We will see!\\nOrdered a plaque for our marketer of the month and online ordering was a very quick and easy process and was shipped in a timely manner.\\nI have been working with my corporation since 2006 and could not be more trusting of their service.

For our almost 3week trip I decided to attempt to save a bit so chose the WP outdoor lot on PAC Ave and 188th.\\n\\nI was a little nervous leaving our car outside in a fenced lot.  I prepaid the stay, arrived, found a parking spot and the pickup van was there to take us to the airport.\\n\\nUpon our return, after flying over 14 hous, we had to wait a bit for the van, but our car was secure, check out was easy and the service was great.\\n\\nI appreciate the choices with WP.....you can go first class with Valet, washing, changing oil etc. or park outside in a safe and secure lot.  Parking at the airport isn’t cheap but WP makes it affordable with great services ce.\\nEasy ordering process, product came quickly, exactly as ordered\\nI ordered a Rolex from these guys and it was awesome. I actually called up to see if i would be receiving my watch by new years eve and they told me to hang in there. The next thing i know, i got an email saying it was being shipped overnight to make sure i got in time for my new years eve party. Awesome Job and an awesome website. This is my second Rolex i\\'ve bought from them and will not go anywhere else.\\nGood price, low hasle\\nGreat service, speedy delivery & item arrived in excellent condition.\\nThe site publishes your review as it is. No editing and without taking sides. When there is a reply or a comment related to your review, you get notified and have always a chance to edit/update your review.\\nI find it easy to use, very intuitive and serving a great cause. I would not change anything. Thank you\\nGreat company. Excellent service. From the first notification ,through the delivery. Five Star Company.\\nThe oxygen sensor that i bought didn\\'t work for my car. Apparently Denso makes several oxygen sensors for my 02 Honda Accord. The wires were too short. Furthermore, I needed the one with the California emissions for it to work properly which cost 4x more then the one that I bought.\\nI am putting labels of my son & fiancé on wine bottles for shower gifts!\\nThe  plants arrived well packaged and in very good condition. The instructions that came with the plants were also very useful.\\nGreat selections outstanding quality. Will continue to purchase from their site.\\nComplete authentic and card has worked perfectly in OZ!\\nFast and reliable service\\nPick up and drop off at LAX were fast and easy.\\nI had the best experience at bestassignmentwritets.com ever\\nI made a reservation at DCA location but they do not accept debit cards. So I was addressed to go to the Crystal City location and the service here is great, the cars are cool and the prices are even lower than any other location. Excellent!!!\\nDon\\'t waste your money or time. I bought a part for my car and got a broken part after waiting 4 days. This is for my main car I use to drive to school and couldn\\'t. I called and they have good constomer service. I got a replacement and received a faulty part.  I found out after I got it installed in my car. It\\'s not even a OEM part. Which the website promises. Don\\'t waste your time and money. There constomer service hours are terrible and it feels like I can\\'t get in touch with the company. They need to start checking the parts the junk yards are sending because they are sending bad parts  and cheap parts.\\nMaria was great at communicating and getting us moved in!\\nThe citypass made it so much easier for my family and I to see many of Toronto\\'s beautiful tourist locations without breaking the bank.\\nI go to travelocity first.  I\\'ve been using it since it started and haven\\'t felt the desire to look elsewhere.  It\\'s easy to use and trustworthy.\\nUpon entering the hotel, we were told that we had no reservation for the hotel and no parksleepfly reservation as well.  I showed the hotel employee our printed reservation , but he said that your company never forwarded the reservation to the hotel.  We made this reservation 4 days prior to the day of service, so naturally, we were very upset.  We called your company but didn\\'t get any satisfaction until our second call to your company.  Not sure if we\\'ll use you again.\\nThe service was awesome! I ordered my book and it arrived way before the actual arrival date. Customer service is nice and very friendly. I will definitely use their services again! Highly recommend!\\nExtremely wide selection of plants & shrubs that you won\\'t find at your local nursery or big box hardware store. Full info on every plant available with ACCURATE details instead of the vague/broad generalities found on most sites. I have ordered from Bluestone since 2001 and haven\\'t lost a plant yet~ they ship securely, plants are always healthy and as described. I\\'ve been very happy with every order I\\'ve received and will continue shopping with them until I run out of room in my yard!\\nUsed the service last a year ago. When I recently needed to use again, noticed that the prices went up dramatically. Usually this would correspond with better quality or experience. However neither of those things occurred. In fact call quality was not only worse, but atrocious. The first call I made was unable to connect with person I was calling. However I was still billed for the call. I was able to connect with the second call, but person on the other end couldn\\'t hear me. Overall just pathetic.\\nExactly what we wanted for our wedding and got them quick!\\nPassports showed up exactly when the said they would. Was a little leary at first but communication was great.\\nFirst time buy looking forward to doing more to see what you have\\nI want a complete refund! The hotel said they never received the booking and they had no vacancies. I will book my own hotel and I want a complete refund.\\n\"I will hire this professional every time because of her knowledge of the products and for being absolutely thorough and fixing my issues with ease.\"\\nI was charged $99.99 for an All Shine but upon returning saw that only a portion of the car was cleaned. The Keys were left in it and I presume whomever was in charge thought I might not notice that only a portion of the car was cleaned. After addressing with the Manager and the Representative from All Shine I was assured I would receive a refund  from All shine. That was August 17th and I have yet to receive a refund?\\nGreenvelope.com is an amazing way to get the word out about an upcoming events.  They have beautiful invitations and the application is easy to use once you get the hang of it! The tracking ability for RSVP\\'s is such a useful tool.  I would highly recommend this company!\\nWebs is excellent but one of the biggest drawbacks is that you can not use animated .gif images.\\nThe person I spoke to on the phone was considerate, understanding and helpful. The offer of an upgrade to a scuf impact was way more than I expected. I am grateful for scufs consideration considering my faults in the past with my current controller. Am definitely going to tell friends I play with about this and recommend scuf support.\\nitems were priced reasonably and arrived in a timely manner.........would recommend this company\\nI just received my business cards, and they are truly beautiful! The opportunity to put several images on my cards makes giving them out each time a unique experience. Also, when I discovered a small flaw, and called Moo, their customer service employee immediately assured me they would be reprinted, at no charge. What a pleasure to work with a company like this! Five stars for sure!!\\ni have been purchasing products from the RFW for a few years now. It has always been a pleasure! Excellent customer service, great products and reasonable prices. It is very useful to watch your educative videos on YouTube. Thank you team!\\nVery easy experience no hassle\\nHad an order that was to small called and they told me to keep that order at no charge and they sent me a new order for free!\\nQuick, easy, simple to buy !!\\nSimple:  competitive pricing, simple buying process, incredibly speedy delivery.  Great experience\\nFast shipping grate products, please keep up the good work. Definitely will recommend to friends!\\nVery pleased with our order, our daughter loves the wall decals.\\nEasy to use website with competitive prices.\\nPlants are very nice size when sent.   They are also very healthy.  Sometimes they are very dry upon arrival and I receive them very quickly from the initial shipping date.  A few haven’t survived.:(\\nOur SmartPractice representative is THE BEST! Her help and expertise is worthy of 5 stars! Fawn VonGunten is definitely why we have remained using SmartPractice all these years!\\nI ordered the adapter for the Cat fuel filter.  The company provided prompt electronic notifications regarding order being placed and estimated delivery time.  No proplems with this order.\\nExpedia charged me over $50 for a so-called \"Travel Protection Plan\".  But when I had to cancel my flight due to unforeseen circumstances, I was told that I couldn\\'t get a refund unless there is a death in the family or there\\'s a medical condition for which there has to be a note from a doctor to show that the traveler is unable to travel.  So, prospective travelers, unless you do expect a death in your family or some serious medical conditions during your planned travel, don\\'t spend a penny on that useless \"travel protection plan\", and better yet, don\\'t use Expedia for your travel needs.  Instead, contact the airlines, rental car companies, and hotels directly.  With those merchants, you tend to have greater flexibility.\\nPax is the best vape I\\'ve ever used.\\nI ordered a shirt that at the time said was in stock and was able to order.  After a week went by I got no shipping info so I emailed them.  They then told me the shirt was out of stock and gave me my money back.  It took me emailing them to find all this out when they should have let me know as soon as possible.  Second time this has now happened.\\nI love the products that Fabletics offers! On some products the sizing can be off, so just be cautious ordering and look at the sizes. What makes me give it four stars is the customer service. It\\'s not that it\\'s bad necessarily, they just make it really difficult to get out of the VIP services. The only reason I have continued ordering is because I inevitably forget the skip the month and have a credit. I never want to cancel my account until I use that credit. I have called to cancel twice, but as previously mentioned I didn\\'t want to lose the credit that I already paid for. But love the products - especially the leggings!\\nThe time and dedication FDR puts toward solving my debts is remarkable.  I am extremely happy with the outcome of the resolutions they receive.\\nThey told me they failed to authenticate my FarCry4 account. Made me do a two step verification process. So I changed my password and then tried to do the google authentication code process, but it failed even thought they sent me this through my email. If they would send this through my email, why in the hell do I have to punch in that damn code. On top of that I can\\'t call to fix this issue so I have to wait who knows how long until they get back to me to play a game I paid 30 bucks for..... WT...... I should just have downloaded a pirated version and bypass this bull....\\nFirst transaction - 3 days (I think being a new customer)\\r\\nSecond Transaction - 1 Day\\r\\n\\r\\nThird - 5 Minutes!!! amazing.\\nI was happy to find exactly what we were looking for, although it was a bit pricey. The product then arrived damaged, which was disappointing. However, the customer service was great to work with and promptly sent a new product. Overall it was a good experience and I hope the quality holds up.\\nAwesome service knowledgeable n quick to find a dentist to fit ur needs.\\nThe people here are great, first rate customer service, always willing to help. Motion media has a great variety of software at great prices.\\r\\nWell Done!\\nWhen we pulled into to parking lot we noticed there were a lot of nice autos to choose from ,and Scott greeted us we weren\\'t sure ourself if we could afford anything but he and the staff there helped us out and we are happy with our purchase .I want to thank them all\\nMy display had been shaking and pixelating. Every and anything I tried didn\\'t identify or solve the issues. Plus my computer was running SO slow. Found this on-line fix and it worked!!!!\\nAsked for the bulbs in October got them in the middle of September. All bulbs were of good size lets see what happens in the spring\\nI know it is just trash being hauled away, but when i called for a dumpster.  I spoke to one person, paid him, and when it was time to have it hauled off, I spoke to just one person and was graciously allowed a few extra days to continue to toss stuff in the dumpster before they came and retrieved it at no extra cost.  What a deal, the best price in town and a couple extra days to fill the thing.\\nI have ordered from OptiContacts in the past several times.  \\r\\n\\r\\nContacts arrived, as ordered, within a reasonable amount of time. \\r\\n\\r\\nContacts appear to be working well.  That is prescription is correct, and no issues noted to date.  \\r\\n\\r\\nMy only wish is that it would be nice if additional discounts were available without having to order four (4) boxes? of lenses at a time.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIf reasonable discounts were given on lesser order amounts I would be tempted to order two (2) or more boxes? of contacts at a time.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI am a bit skittish about ordering four (4) boxes? of lenses at a time, should my prescription change while I am in possession of a year or more\\'s worth of lenses.\\nFirst time buyer and I\\'m very satisfied first with the prices and second with the fast and secure shipping. The product arrives in excellent conditions and the prescription correctly. I will buy again in the future. Thanks\\nThe car is clean , good performance and fair price. Pick up and drop off is very high efficiency.\\nFittings good and looks classy.\\nthey follow thru with all that they say.its fast and easy\\nThank you! Great experience\\ni am a brandy new customer, though have made a considerable number of purchases within 2 days; and a significant amount of $$$ spent. I already  received one of the handbags ordered - could not believe the expediency with which my order was managed by the seller - and it was my pleasure to have sent her an email communicating my sentiments!!\\n\\nI have also spoken to Blair in customer service who was nothing less than pleasant & efficient; taking a look at some pricing inconsistencies....\\n\\nSo far - a pleasure doing business with your company!\\nLove the search / filtering options contributing to the ease of navigating around the website.\\n\\nThank you.\\nSally Fainbuch\\nYou have to try these,you\\'ll never buy from another company\\nThe taste is wonderful. Add frozen fruit and it tastes like a milk shake. I\\'ve tried others and IdealShape is the best,.\\nService great.   Economical with fuel consumption.\\nI’m very pleased with Marley Spioon - I’m able to cook and serve tasty and nutritious meals.  My elderly father who loves comfort food has liked many of the vegetarian meals.  I have been able to solve “what’s for dinner “, enjoy cooking and please everyone at dinner time.  Thank you!\\nBooks arrived in a timely fashion. Condition was very good to excellent.\\nBevery\\nEverything I have ordered has been great and arrived in a timely\\nmannaer\\nIve been inquiring into different ticketing website and spoken to different agents, all agents was so unprofessional and felt like they are rushing me to purchase the ticket with them. I couldn\\'t feel the willingness to help me for my needs. upon browsing, i was prompted into ASAP tickets and spoke to this gentlemen His name is Wendell, who is very polite, respectful, professional, willing to help and listen to the need of a costumer during their flight. This guy helped me all through out the processing up to my request for a wheelchair for my mom. it was smooth transaction with him. as a matter of fact he also helped me to purchased a seat for us. Wendell puts a smile in his voice that made me purchased my ticket at ASAP Tickets. This employee is an asset of the company. Wish him all the best!\\nI have been using WallyPark for our last 3 trips and love it! They cater to their customers and it is so nice to come back to a warm car in the cold winter months. My only complaint is that I did request covered valet and I am sure it was not covered by how dirty the car was. The valet also changed my radio station and had some hip hop station blaring when I got into the car. Not a big deal but I really see no reason to mess with the radio in patron\\'s cars. I will continue to use WallyPark for all my trips especially if I can get a groupon deal to lower the price.\\nEverything went perfectly! Smooth ordering process, friendly and helpful customer service. Very good product. Would recommend to my friends...\\nOverall a good service.\\r\\nThere are some arbitrary restrictions that are just enough to be annoying, without being a show-stopper.  For example, there is a _very_ restricted set of file types that one may upload and make available. \\r\\nClear signs of effort being expended to make the site easy. Big plus!\\nThe products I ordered were simply perfect. CafePress made online shopping effortless.\\nEvery book I have gotten has been better than its review and the shipping is so quick! Thank you!!\\nWill recommend this Agoda to mu family and friends!\\nThe first round of proofs were delivered and we had something to work with.  Round 2 blew us away.  Three of the proofs were good enough and one was a home run.  The next few revisions were to dial in color and font.  We couldn\\'t be happier.  I will recommend The Logo Company in the future and I will use their services again soon.\\nWebsite was informative (only wish there were more cuts reviews to help substantiate ratings). Didn\\'t buy on-line but came into the shop and was assisted by a helpful/knowledgeable associate. Bought the tired I had researched (thanks to additional info from the associate).  Tired were installed in a timely manner. Overall, a very easy process and I feel good about my purchase.\\nFast, easy, great service.\\nI was checking multiple sites and found Priceline comparable. I like it is easy to use.\\nI absolutely love our furniture and had the most amazing guys bring and set up our furniture!! Very very happy with our purchases and service provided!!!\\nAlways great service and top notch quality\\nWebsite had everything I needed and the item arrived quickly and was the correct item.\\nDecent price and service. Discount offering on the website didn\\'t work but I found a discount code on the internet so it only amounted to a couple bucks.\\nTrip back on Pegasus was awful. I was in the isle seat and the middle seat was occupied by a 22 stone lump who took a great part of my seat as well.  The arm rests could not be put down.  The flight was full so I could not move seats.  People like that should pay for the seats they are occupying, that is two.\\nWe were unaware that we only had 15kg of luggage for two people. We were under the impression that we had 15kg each.\\nThis stuff I love it I drink with skim milk because I have to get milk in my diet this stuff is great taste so good I have  the chocolate  flavor I love the shake u can drink right out of it not have to pour into glass . I for sure will be ordering this again when I am almost. Last night I did not feel the best  had a   ideal felt better after I had one , does wonders I have 11pounds starting 2 weeks ago I stick with the program to a tea love love this thank you. Wasn\\'t sure thought oh what the heck try it  so glad I did. I highly recommend  this,\\nOverall this is a great company, however I do not order from them as frequently because I like to send the vase with the flowers becuase I never want to assume that someone has a vase, and I really hate the vase option. But there is only one vase to choose from. :(\\nThis was a great trip first time to have a  a fixed time and place to be . We got to Ireland  at 4:30 in the morning, might think that would be bad. It was perfect. We picked up our car and drove to the village our first castle was located. Ask about thing close by.  We did all the driving with no traffic. Mostly on the motorway. Transition was easy.\\n   Castles were amazing. Service incredible  (almost offended by tipping ) did it anyway.  Food fresh,  Alot of it came out of Spain. Pineapple was as good as Hawaii.  \\n   We  extended our flight home. Flew to Liverpool ($9.99 each way) to attend the Preston England temple. When we got back to Ireland we spent 16 days bumming around . We even made it to Norther Ireland  . . . Had one castle that was nasty, changed rooms it was freshly redone. Powers Court  by Marriott was 7 stars in our book.\\n     We will definitely book again.\\nPerfect fit. The print is exactly what I wanted\\nCouldn\\'t find what we were looking for anywhere...but we found it here.  Great Job!\\nI just got into wet shaving and West Coast Shaving has everything I need at great prices. They have friendly and helpful workers. If you\\'re new to wet shaving, just getting back into it, or a long time user, you should check it out.'"
